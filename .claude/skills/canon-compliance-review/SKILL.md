# Canon Compliance Review

## When to use
Any change to gameplay logic, state, or outputs.

## Instructions
1. Read relevant canon documents, phase specs, invariants, and tests.
2. Map each proposed change to specific canon clauses.
3. Identify gaps or ambiguous canon for any change.
4. If ambiguity exists, STOP AND ASK with the ambiguity list.
5. Summarize canon compliance in change notes.

## Must never
- Invent mechanics or resolve canon ambiguity without approval.

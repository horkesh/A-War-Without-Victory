Strategic Wargame UI Analysis & Recommendations
TIER 1: Primary Influences
AGEOD System (Civil War II, Wars of Napoleon)
Architecture:
Main map with zoom levels (strategic → operational → tactical)
Left sidebar: "Decision Pack" with expandable sections
Right sidebar: Unit/region details
Bottom bar: Turn controls, time, resources
Floating windows: Reports, diplomacy, production
Key Innovations:
Decision Pack Cards : Collapsible sections for different domains
Military (corps, armies, units)
Economic (production, resources)
Diplomatic (relations, treaties)
Intelligence (enemy movements)
Unit Detail Panel : Shows full unit composition, supply, morale, entrenchment
Chain of Command Visualization : Corps → Division → Brigade hierarchy
Region Details : Population, loyalty, resources, garrison requirements
What to Adopt:   ✅   Decision Pack card system (perfect for our tabs)   ✅   Detailed unit composition view   ✅
Supply line visualization on map   ✅   Separate "military operations" vs "strategic overview" views
Hearts of Iron IV
Architecture:
Central map (dominant)
Top bar: Resources, factories, political power
Left sidebar (toggleable): Tech tree, focus tree, production
Right sidebar: Selected unit/territory info
Bottom: Theatre/army management, battle planner
Key Innovations:
Theatre System : Group multiple armies under theatres

--- Page 2 ---
Battle Plan Painter : Draw offensive lines, fallback lines
Division Designer : Template-based unit creation
Supply Map Mode : Dedicated layer showing supply hub ranges
Air Wings Panel : Separate management for air assets
What to Adopt:   ✅   Supply map mode (show supply propagation visually)   ✅   Battle planner concept (for
tactical group operations)   ✅   Division template idea (for brigade type standardization)   ❌   Too much
automation (contradicts our constraint philosophy)
Gary Grigsby's War in the East
Architecture:
Hex map (primary)
Left panel: Unit list (hierarchical tree)
Right panel: Detailed hex info
Bottom: Multi-tab command interface
Modal windows: Combat resolution, logistics, reports
Key Innovations:
Hierarchical Unit Tree : Army Group → Army → Corps → Division
Expandable/collapsible
Shows supply state, readiness, HQ attachment
Logistics Detail Screen : Dedicated view for supply network
Commander Details : Leader traits affect subordinate units
Combat Prediction : Shows odds before committing
End Turn Resolution : Detailed phase-by-phase display
What to Adopt:   ✅   Hierarchical unit tree (perfect for corps → brigades)   ✅   Logistics detail screen (for
supply/corridor management)   ✅   Combat prediction (exhaustion cost preview)   ✅   Detailed turn resolution
phases
TIER 2: Supporting Influences
Unity of Command II
Best Feature :   Objective-Based Operations
Assign units to operational objectives

--- Page 3 ---
Visual clarity: clean, readable map
Supply dependency shown via HQ links
"Prestige points" limit what you can do (similar to our exhaustion)
Adopt:   ✅   Objective markers (directives visualized on map)   ✅   HQ link visualization (supply chains)   ✅
Action point economy (exhaustion as limiting factor)
Decisive Campaigns: Barbarossa
Best Feature :   Decision Cards System
Turn starts with "decisions" to make
Each decision has trade-offs
Affects morale, politics, logistics
Some decisions locked based on game state
Adopt:   ✅   Start-of-turn decision phase (issue directives)   ✅   Trade-off visualization (exhaustion vs. gains)   ✅
State-dependent options (early war vs. main war)
Shadow Empire
Best Feature :   Multi-Layer Territory Management
Strategic map → Operational map → Tactical map
Different information at each zoom level
Region cards show: population, production, unrest, assets
Supply network explicitly modeled with logistics units
Adopt:   ✅   Region card concept (municipality detail cards)   ✅   Multi-layer information (don't show everything
at once)   ✅   Explicit supply network visualization
Command: Modern Operations
Best Feature :   Mission-Based Orders
Units assigned to missions (patrol, strike, support)
Mission parameters define behavior
Detailed sensor/weapons management
Adopt:   ✅   Mission concept for tactical groups (assault, relief, defense)   ❌   Too much micromanagement for
our scope

SYNTHESIS: Recommended UI Architecture
Core Philosophy
"Map as reference, panels as workspace"
Like AGEOD and Grigsby, the map is always visible but   panels are where decisions happen .
RECOMMENDED UI SYSTEM
Layout: Fixed 3-Panel + Modal Overlays
LEFT PANEL: "Decision Layers" (AGEOD-inspired)
Expandable card system with   5 primary layers :
1. Strategic Overview   🎯

KEY DESIGN DECISIONS
✅   ADOPT FROM AGEOD:
Collapsible decision layers (not tabs, cards that expand)
Rich detail panels
Supply line visualization on map
✅   ADOPT FROM GRIGSBY:
Hierarchical unit tree (Corps → Brigades)

--- Page 14 ---
Detailed turn resolution phases
Combat/operation prediction
Logistics screen
✅   ADOPT FROM HOI4:
Map modes (supply, pressure, etc.)
Theatre concept (Corps in our case)
Battle planner (for TG operations)
✅   ADOPT FROM UNITY OF COMMAND:
Objective markers on map
Clean visual language
Action point economy (exhaustion)
✅   ADOPT FROM DECISIVE CAMPAIGNS:
Start-of-turn decision cards
Trade-off visualization
Event system
❌   AVOID:
Too much automation (contradicts constraints)
Real-time elements (we're turn-based)
Excessive micromanagement (Command MGRS)
Hidden mechanics (transparency is key)
IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY
Phase 1 (Foundation):   ✅   DONE
Basic game state
Municipality data structure
Phase 2 (Core UI): NEXT
Left panel decision layers
Right context panel

--- Page 15 ---
Map mode switching
Click interactions
Phase 3 (Military):
Corps/brigade tree
Brigade detail view
TG formation modal
Phase 4 (Operations):
Turn resolution system
Supply calculation
Exhaustion updates
Event system
Phase 5 (Polish):
Directive system
Advanced visualizations
Tooltips and help
Keyboard shortcuts
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Panel System:
Context Panel (React-like pattern):
javascript
// Collapsible card system (AGEOD-style)
const   decisionLayers   =   {
strategic :   {   expanded :   true ,   content :   StrategicOverviewComponent   } ,
military :   {   expanded :   false ,   content :   MilitaryCommandComponent   } ,
territory :   {   expanded :   false ,   content :   TerritoryComponent   } ,
population :   {   expanded :   false ,   content :   PopulationComponent   } ,
diplomacy :   {   expanded :   false ,   content :   DiplomacyComponent   }
} ;
javascript

--- Page 16 ---
Modal Stack:
Map Modes:
FINAL RECOMMENDATION
Use a hybrid approach:
AGEOD's collapsible decision layers   for the left panel
Grigsby's hierarchical trees   for military organization
HOI4's map modes   for visualization
Decisive Campaigns' decision cards   for directives
Unity of Command's clarity   for visual design
This gives you:
// Right panel changes based on selection
function   renderContextPanel ( )   {
if   ( gameState . selectedBrigade )   return   BrigadeDetailView ( ) ;
if   ( gameState . selectedMunicipality )   return   MunicipalityDetailView ( ) ;
if   ( gameState . selectedCorps )   return   CorpsDetailView ( ) ;
return   SituationReportView ( ) ;
}
javascript
// Modals appear over map, can be stacked
const   modalStack   =   [ ] ;
function   openModal ( type ,   data )   {
modalStack . push ( {   type ,   data   } ) ;
renderModal ( modalStack [ modalStack . length   -   1 ] ) ;
}
javascript
// Map visualization modes
const   mapModes   =   {
control :   ( mun )   =>   getControlColor ( mun . politicalControl ) ,
supply :   ( mun )   =>   getSupplyColor ( mun . supplyState ) ,
pressure :   ( mun )   =>   getPressureColor ( mun . pressureLevel ) ,
population :   ( mun )   =>   getEthnicColor ( mun . population . ethnic )
} ;

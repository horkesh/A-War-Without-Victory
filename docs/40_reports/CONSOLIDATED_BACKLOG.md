## 7. Bot AI remaining work (from BOT_AI_INVESTIGATION_AND_OVERHAUL_2026_02_13)

The report [BOT_AI_INVESTIGATION_AND_OVERHAUL_2026_02_13.md](implemented/BOT_AI_INVESTIGATION_AND_OVERHAUL_2026_02_13.md) lists **Remaining Issues (Future Work)**:

- AoR extreme imbalance (HIGH)
- RS early-war underperformance (MEDIUM)
- Defender casualties at zero (MEDIUM)
- HRHB near-passive (LOW–MEDIUM)
- Posture orders for forming brigades (LOW)
- Corps command not integrated with brigade AI (LOW)
- Operational groups not used by bot AI (LOW)

Treat these as backlog items for bot/brigade AI when prioritizing.

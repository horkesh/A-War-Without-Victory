# Process QA — Launchable GUI planning phase (T10)

**Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Scope:** Validate that Orchestrator/PM and research owners followed established process during the launchable GUI planning phase (T1–T9). No code or canon changed; planning and convene docs only.

---

## Checklist and evidence

1. **context.md (or docs_index) read before work**
   - **Evidence:** Plan referenced context (ledger structure, convene docs in docs/40_reports/convenes/). Deliverables align with context: decision memo, convene note, research memos, phased plan. No FORAWWV edit.
   - **Result:** PASS.

2. **PROJECT_LEDGER updated for behavioral/output/scenario changes**
   - **Evidence:** Ledger entry appended to docs/PROJECT_LEDGER.md dated 2026-02-14: "Orchestrator: Launchable GUI planning phase (play myself + rewatch)". Describes convene docs, scope memo, research memos, phased plan, recommended stack. Planning phase does not change behavior/outputs/scenarios directly; entry documents the planning execution and artifacts for continuity. PROJECT_LEDGER_KNOWLEDGE: N/A for this entry (planning execution; thematic GUI/launchable knowledge can be added later if desired).
   - **Result:** PASS.

3. **Napkin read at session start**
   - **Evidence:** Napkin was read at session start (per agent workflow). Work aligned with napkin (paths, patterns, no edits to FORAWWV). No napkin update required for planning-only deliverables.
   - **Result:** PASS.

4. **Commit-per-phase discipline**
   - **Evidence:** No commits were made in this session (planning only; user may commit in a single phase scope as "Orchestrator: Launchable GUI planning phase"). When committing, single scope = planning phase (docs/40_reports/convenes/* + PROJECT_LEDGER).
   - **Result:** PASS.

5. **FORAWWV.md not edited**
   - **Evidence:** No edits to FORAWWV.md. No reference to FORAWWV in created docs.
   - **Result:** PASS.

6. **Canon and determinism considered**
   - **Evidence:** T5 produced ORCHESTRATOR_CANON_AND_SPECS_CHECKLIST_GUI_2026_02_14.md (canon constraints, determinism, no new mechanics). T4 and T7/T8 referenced existing sim and replay format (deterministic). Phased plan (T9) states determinism preserved; no new randomness or timestamps in implementation.
   - **Result:** PASS.

## Process audit result: **PASS**

All checklist items satisfied. Planning phase followed process: context/ledger, napkin at session start, ledger updated, no FORAWWV edit, canon and determinism addressed in research and plan. Ready for implementation phase when user approves; handoff to dev per ORCHESTRATOR_PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_GUI_2026_02_14.md.

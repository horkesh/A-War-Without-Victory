## Prompt 1: RBiH Command HQ (Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina)

```
A cinematic frontal-view illustration of a Bosnian government command headquarters,
designed for a 2D strategy game interface, circa 1992. The composition is
divided into two horizontal sections:

TOP SECTION (70% of frame): Above the wall map, centered at the top, is the
Coat of Arms of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina mounted on a wooden plaque:
a white shield with six golden fleur-de-lis arranged in diagonal band on blue
background. Below this, a large strategic map of Bosnia and Herzegovina is
mounted on a concrete wall, rendered in NATO tactical style with GREEN hatched
zones (horizontal lines, representing RBiH-controlled territory), RED diagonal-
hatched zones (Republika Srpska forces), and BLUE polka-dotted zones (Herzeg-
Bosnia). The map shows hand-drawn frontlines in thick black dashes, topographic
contours in brown, major cities labeled in stencil capitals (Sarajevo, Banja
Luka, Mostar, Tuzla), and rivers in blue ink. "TOP SECRET" stamp in red at
upper left corner, "SECRET NOFORN" stamp in red at lower right. UTM grid
reference numbers along edges. A simple analog wall clock to the upper-right
shows "Week 23, June 1992" on a card below it.

desk surface, showing these objects left to right:

Same composition as Prompt 1 (RBiH HQ) but with DESPERATE desperation state:

TOP SECTION: Map heavily annotated with red and blue grease pencil scribbles,
15+ pushpins stuck in various locations, torn edges at corners from constant
handling, visible wear and creases.

BOTTOM SECTION - DESPERATE state changes:
- ASHTRAY: 18+ cigarette butts overflowing, 2-3 butts on desk surface outside
  ashtray, ash scattered
- COFFEE: 3 cups visible - one tipped over with dried spill, one empty with
  heavy residue stains, one half-empty; multiple coffee ring stains on desk

   - Isolate desk section (bottom 30%) for separate layer
   - Create alpha masks for interactive object hotspots
   - Export as: `hq_rbih_stable.png`, `hq_rbih_desperate.png`, etc.
3. Create additional variants:
   - Strained (40% between stable and critical)
   - Critical (70% between stable and desperate)

### For National Crests (Prompt 5):

1. Generate high-res versions
2. Ensure transparent background

## Color Reference (For Consistency)

Ensure all generated images use these exact RGB values for faction zones:

- **RBiH (Friendly)**: `rgb(70, 120, 80)` — Forest Green
- **RS (Enemy)**: `rgb(180, 50, 50)` — Crimson Red
- **HRHB (Allied)**: `rgb(60, 100, 140)` — Steel Blue

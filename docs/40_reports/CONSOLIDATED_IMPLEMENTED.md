# Consolidated: Implemented Work (40_reports)

**Purpose:** Single view of work that has been implemented and absorbed into code/canon.

**As of 2026-02-15:** All implemented report content has been consolidated into one dated document. Individual reports have been archived (not deleted).

| What you need | Where to go |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Full consolidated content** | [IMPLEMENTED_WORK_CONSOLIDATED_2026_02_15.md](IMPLEMENTED_WORK_CONSOLIDATED_2026_02_15.md) — sections 1–12 with all implementation summaries (§10 = Warroom/Phase 0 and systems integration; §11 = Warroom restyle, Apr 1992 scenario fix, embedded tactical map, fog-of-war; §12 = deterministic org-pen initialization and Phase 0->I handoff alignment). |
| **Archived individual reports** | `docs/_old/40_reports/implemented_2026_02_15/` — original report files preserved for history. New reports (2026-02-16) remain in [implemented/WARROOM_RESTYLE_SCENARIO_FIX_EMBEDDED_MAP_FOG_OF_WAR_2026_02_16.md](implemented/WARROOM_RESTYLE_SCENARIO_FIX_EMBEDDED_MAP_FOG_OF_WAR_2026_02_16.md) and [implemented/ORG_PEN_FORMULA_INIT_AND_PHASE0_HANDOFF_2026_02_16.md](implemented/ORG_PEN_FORMULA_INIT_AND_PHASE0_HANDOFF_2026_02_16.md). |

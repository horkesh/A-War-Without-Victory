# AWWV Command Board

**Status:** Derived dispatch view, synchronized 2026-08-26.

**Authority:** [MASTER_ROADMAP.md](MASTER_ROADMAP.md) is the sole authority for unfinished work and wins if this board differs.

## Activation

The owner activated full roadmap execution on 2026-07-31. Local implementation, tests, evidence, commits, approved remote pushes, final merge to `main`, documentation propagation, and repository cleanup are authorized within the roadmap.

Signing, store upload, public release creation, and a public `1.0` tag remain outside that authority and require a separate explicit `Publish 1.0` instruction.

## Dispatch Queue

| Order | ID | Status | Next executable action | Plan |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | R1 | **COMPLETE -- CLOSED 2026-08-01** | None. | [Seamless map transition](2026-07-31-seamless-command-room-map-transition-plan.md) |
| 2 | R2 | **COMPLETE -- CLOSED 2026-08-03** | None; v14 is the accepted clean RS campaign proof. | [RS friction remediation](2026-07-31-rs-104week-friction-remediation-plan.md) |
| 3 | R3 | **COMPLETE** | None. | [TG convergence](2026-07-31-operational-tactical-group-closeout-implementation-plan.md) |
| 4 | R4 | **COMPLETE** | None; Phase 6 and its packaging follow-up are closed. | [Command/event/Codex convergence](2026-07-31-command-event-codex-convergence-plan.md) |
| 5 | R5 | **COMPLETE -- CLOSED 2026-08-05** | None. The accepted performance floor is approximately 1.09 seconds per turn; the 100 ms target and incremental-reuse Task 6 are retired from 1.0 scope. | [Engine quality](2026-07-31-engine-quality-performance-stability-plan.md) |
| 6 | R6 | **JANUARY 1993 CHECKPOINT REACTIVATED BY OWNER — n372 ACCEPTED** | Continue the Srebrenica–Zvornik regional mismatch pass on week 39 of the single 188-week master. Preserve 697/712 national and 59/62 accepted Goražde-focus truth; do not use direct calibration control events or a 40-week scenario. | [Calibration authority](../40_reports/CALIBRATION_MASTER.md) |
| 6.5 | RC | **PRE-1.0 NARROW SCOPE COMPLETE -- CLOSED 2026-08-15** | None. V3 selection plus reversible D-shape is retained; D-topology is reserved post-1.0. | [Collapse build spec](../40_reports/proposals/20260609_COLLAPSE_PIPELINE_BUILD_SPEC.md) / [D-shape result](2026-08-15-collapse-d-shape-design.md) |
| 7 | R7 | **ACTIVE -- PHASE 2 AND OPENING EXPERIENCE COMPLETE 2026-08-23** | The provenance/OOB reopening is closed with source-bound and controlled-run evidence. The case-file opening, explicit campaign mode, safe Field Records, and real browser proofs are merged. Next: audio/licensing, English accessibility/readability, then integrated packaged proof. Localization Phase 3 is post-1.0. | [Content/history/audio](2026-07-31-content-history-localization-audio-plan.md) / [opening implementation](2026-08-23-opening-screens-implementation-plan.md) |
| 8 | R8 | **WAITING ON RC AND R1-R7 GREEN** | Run fresh full-duration packaged-Electron RBiH, RS, and HRHB campaigns; fix bugs before friction; repeat until the final two diaries score 5/5. | [Electron validation](2026-07-31-full-campaign-electron-validation-plan.md) |
| 9 | R9 | **WAITING ON R8** | Freeze an immutable RC, produce reproducible clean-machine evidence, and prepare publication inputs. | [Release candidate/gold](2026-07-31-release-candidate-gold-publication-plan.md) |

## Current Critical Path

`R6 January checkpoint -> R7 content/history/audio/accessibility -> R8 -> R9`

**MEASUREMENT BLOCKER CLOSED.** Run provenance now stamps commit, consumed-input evidence, and flag state; the pair selector hard-fails on incomparable artifacts. A fresh same-commit collapse OFF/ON pair passed the Section 6 discriminator with positive controls. The old mixed-tree n222/n223 pair remains permanently inadmissible and must not be reused.

**CURRENT EXECUTION:** owner-reactivated January 1993 calibration, currently on the
Srebrenica–Zvornik follow-on after accepted Goražde n372. R7 audio/licensing resumes afterward,
then English accessibility/readability and integrated packaged proof.

**Canon landed 2026-08-17:** `SENSITIVE_HISTORY_DESIGN_GATE.md` §10, "Provenance and the Integrity of the Historical Record", ratified by unanimous Pyrrhic panel. `FORAWWV.md` §XIII temporal scope is drafted but **HELD** behind the provenance channel-separation and determinism-scan packets, and is not canon.

RC's narrow pre-1.0 scope is complete. Frontage-days and same-turn selection were retired; the retained v3 two-turn selector preserves the registered Sipovo/Drvar distinction. Reversible D-shape then fixed the event-only persistence clock and produced one bounded live HRHB write at Bucovaca while preserving all anchors, health gates, deterministic artifacts, and Section 6 exclusions. Neighbour-cascade D-topology is reserved post-1.0 and must not be replaced by struck breadth tuning. R7 is now the live lane.

## Fixed Decisions

- Five presidential levers; Decision Room owns action.
- Quiet historical intervals use positive-hold briefings, never fabricated decisions.
- TG constants: 12-turn maximum, 4 cohesion drain, dissolve at 15, four-turn Army-HQ cap tail.
- ADR-0007 Phase C remains retired; narrower live Standing-OG behavior is documented.
- Unknown historical identities/content are omitted.
- English is the sole required 1.0 language. The settled `bs`/`bs-BA` and legacy-`bcs` migration contract is retained for post-1.0 localization.
- First-party, CC0, or approved CC BY audio only.
- Steam primary; signed Windows, notarized macOS, Linux AppImage.
- Publication is separately authorized; credentials are injected inputs.

See [Master Roadmap Section 6](MASTER_ROADMAP.md#6-locked-product-and-historical-decisions) for the complete decision record and sources.

## Backlog (Non-Blocking)

Optional improvements outside the 1.0 outcome live in [Master Roadmap Section 10](MASTER_ROADMAP.md#10-finding-routing), not as dispatch rows. Current entries include post-1.0 multilingual localization, faction-wide equipment totals visibility, Local Support commitment redesign, and player-facing Sector-to-Operational-Group naming.

## Workstream Update Protocol

When a workstream changes state:

1. Update its plan checklist and evidence.
2. Update the authoritative master-roadmap snapshot and workstream row.
3. Mirror the state and next action here in the same change.
4. Append the ledger entry required by the plan.
5. Verify links, diff hygiene, and applicable tests.
6. Commit only when active execution authority permits it.

Do not add a competing active queue. Route new findings through [Master Roadmap Section 10](MASTER_ROADMAP.md#10-finding-routing).

## Execution Hygiene

- Inspect status, branch, and worktrees before every packet.
- Never reset, clean, delete, stash, or overwrite unrelated user work.
- One workstream owns a shared file at a time.
- Failed experiments close as evidence-backed no-go results.
- Unexplained drift, determinism failure, unsupported history, or failing package diagnostics blocks the faulty change, not the rest of the queue.
- Do not edit `docs/10_canon/FORAWWV.md`.

## Completion

This board becomes all green only when R1-R9 and RC satisfy the [master definition of program completion](MASTER_ROADMAP.md#12-definition-of-program-completion). Prepared for publication and published are separate states.

# A War Without Victory — Master Roadmap

**Status:** IN AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION; R1/R3 are complete and R2 source packets are independently approved

**Last updated:** 2026-08-01

**Execution branch:** `codex/master-roadmap-execution` (integration target: `main` after all workstreams are green)

**Authority:** This file is the sole source of truth for unfinished product work.

**Execution view:** [COMMAND_BOARD.md](COMMAND_BOARD.md) is a derived convenience view; this roadmap wins if they differ.

**Plan index:** [README.md](README.md)

## 1. Outcome

Ship a historically grounded, deterministic, polished 1.0 in which the player can move through:

`Desk -> Decision Room -> evidence/map/Army HQ -> decision or explicit hold -> Advance`

without hidden required work, long unexplained decision droughts, map-entry stalls, duplicate operational systems, unsupported historical claims, or release-only surprises.

The program is now finite:

- nine executable workstreams, R1–R9;
- one plan per workstream;
- one dependency order;
- no unresolved owner, product, design, or canon choices;
- evidence-led adopt-or-retire branches where an experiment may legitimately fail;
- external signing credentials and publication authority treated as inputs, not design questions.

Prior roadmap history remains in Git before this consolidation and in [PROJECT_LEDGER.md](../PROJECT_LEDGER.md), [PROJECT_LEDGER_KNOWLEDGE.md](../PROJECT_LEDGER_KNOWLEDGE.md), and the [D2 owner-diary closeout](../40_reports/implemented/20260731_D2_OWNER_DIARY_REMEDIATION_AND_REPOSITORY_CLOSEOUT.md). It is not duplicated here.

## 2. Authority and Activation

The owner activated the complete roadmap on 2026-07-31 and subsequently authorized implementation, commits, remote pushes, final merge to `main`, documentation propagation, and repository/worktree/branch cleanup. That explicit instruction supersedes the planning-pass restriction on commits and pushes for this execution program.

Signing, store upload, public release creation, and a public `1.0` tag remain unauthorized until the owner separately says `Publish 1.0` (or equally explicit wording). Transient local/directory Electron builds and immutable release-candidate evidence remain authorized where R8/R9 require them.

| Owner instruction | Autonomous authority granted |
|---|---|
| `Execute the master roadmap` | Implement R1–R9 in dependency order; create/reuse isolated `codex/` worktrees; edit source/docs/tests/data; run research and verification; make local commits; create transient unpacked/directory Electron builds needed for R8 and release dry-runs. |
| An explicit named workstream, such as `Execute R3` | Perform that workstream and its required prerequisite checks only. |
| `Publish 1.0` or equally explicit wording | After R9 readiness is green, use supplied secure credentials, sign/notarize, upload, push the release branch/tag, and change public release state. |

`Execute the master roadmap` does **not** authorize a remote push, public tag, signing, store upload, installer publication, or public release. Those remain behind the separate publication instruction because they affect external systems and are difficult to undo.

## 3. What “No Gates” Means

The old queue repeatedly stopped for an owner verdict even when research, canon, code, or a bounded experiment could resolve the issue. Those pauses are removed.

The following are no longer allowed:

- “ask the owner which design option to use” when this roadmap already chooses one;
- “wait for historian approval” with no stated evidence rule;
- “tune until it feels right” with no adoption criteria;
- “refresh the baseline” merely because output changed;
- “invent a decision” to fill a quiet historical interval;
- keeping a residual lane alive after it has an adopt-or-retire result.

The following safeguards remain mandatory:

- failing tests, determinism, conservation, migration, accessibility, security, historical-substantiation, or clean-package criteria stop the faulty change;
- unexplained baseline drift is investigated, never re-blessed automatically;
- unsupported historical claims and identities are omitted;
- secrets and signing credentials never enter the repository;
- external publication waits for `Publish 1.0`;
- `docs/10_canon/FORAWWV.md` is not edited by this roadmap.

These are verification barriers and authority boundaries, not unresolved product choices.

## 4. Program Sequence

```text
R1 Map transition
  -> R2 RS Desk/Decision/Advance friction
       -> R4 Command/event/Codex convergence

R3 Tactical Group convergence
  -> R5 Engine quality/performance/stability
       -> R6 Historical gameplay depth/final calibration

R4 + R6 + stable R1/R2 UI
  -> R7 Content/history/localization/audio

R1–R7 green
  -> R8 Full packaged-Electron validation

Two clean 5/5 R8 diaries + all barriers green
  -> R9 Release candidate/gold/publication readiness
```

Execute serially in the order R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 unless file-ownership inspection proves two packets are independent. Serial execution is the default because the known collisions are more expensive than the saved wall time.

## 5. Workstream Register

| ID | Workstream | Status | Executable plan | Complete when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Seamless Command Room ↔ Tactical Map | **COMPLETE — CLOSED 2026-08-01** | [Map-transition plan](2026-07-31-seamless-command-room-map-transition-plan.md) | Warm switch shows current-turn/current-fingerprint truth without renderer reconstruction, static refetch, WebGL error, or visible wait; cold entry meets the measured plan budget. |
| R2 | RS Desk → Decision → Advance friction | **IN PROGRESS — ALL SOURCE PACKETS REVIEWED; FRESH PACKAGED RS ACCEPTANCE NEXT** | [RS friction plan](2026-07-31-rs-104week-friction-remediation-plan.md) | Five diary findings close; no contradictory urgency; sourced opportunity/positive-hold cadence is intelligible; ultrawide and map handoff pass Electron proof. |
| R3 | Operational/Tactical Group convergence | **COMPLETE** | [TG closeout plan](2026-07-31-operational-tactical-group-closeout-implementation-plan.md) | One offensive task-organization path, synchronized lifecycle/AHQ receipts, terminal telemetry, unique sourced promotions, locked exhaustion constants, and aligned Standing-OG doctrine. |
| R4 | Command, event, and Dynamic Codex convergence | READY AFTER R2 | [Command/event/Codex plan](2026-07-31-command-event-codex-convergence-plan.md) | Five presidential levers remain; Decision Room owns action; Desk owns triage; events, Chronicle, Cost Ledger, and Codex share deterministic receipts and priority truth. |
| R5 | Engine quality, performance, and stability | **IN PROGRESS — PHASES 0–1 COMPLETE; RECEIPT CORRECTION PROOF GREEN; PERFORMANCE REGRESSION OPEN** | [Engine-quality plan](2026-07-31-engine-quality-performance-stability-plan.md) | Optional state is classified, measured hot paths improve without byte drift, save/replay contracts are stable, generated artifacts have owners, and local/CI release checks match. |
| R6 | Historical gameplay depth and final calibration | **IN PROGRESS — GORAŽDE EVENT-STATE BUG CLOSED; PHASE 0.2 WAITS ON R5 FLOOR** | [Historical-gameplay plan](2026-07-31-historical-gameplay-depth-calibration-plan.md) | Calendar/weak-predicate events cannot manufacture control; every behavior experiment is adopted or retired by predeclared criteria; Sarajevo and fall-1995 work is historically bounded; final 40/104/188-turn evidence is deterministic. |
| R7 | Content, attribution, Bosnian localization, and audio | **IN PROGRESS — PHASE 0 CORRECTION/REVIEW; REMEDIATION OPEN** | [Content/localization/audio plan](2026-07-31-content-history-localization-audio-plan.md) | Claims, identities, strings, and audio are machine-auditable; unsupported content is absent; `bs`/legacy migration, pseudolocale, licensing, accessibility, and Electron proof pass. |
| R8 | Full-campaign packaged-Electron validation and diaries | READY AFTER R1–R7 | [Electron-validation plan](2026-07-31-full-campaign-electron-validation-plan.md) | Fresh historical-policy RBiH, RS, and HRHB campaigns cover full duration and required surfaces; bugs and friction are separately routed; final two diaries score 5/5 with clean diagnostics. |
| R9 | Release candidate, gold, and publication | READY AFTER R8 | [Release plan](2026-07-31-release-candidate-gold-publication-plan.md) | One immutable RC passes clean-machine/security/license/store proofs; artifacts are reproducible; signing/upload inputs are documented; publication awaits only the explicit instruction. |

The linked plan is the task-level contract for each row. A workstream may not gain a second active plan; amend the linked plan and this register together.

### 2026-08-01 R6 Goražde event-state amendment

R6 Task 0.1 is closed. `gorazde_pocket_consolidation_1992` now observes exact live control of Glamoč and Kamen and never creates it. Red-first coverage, a matched 40-week comparison, a causally reviewed 52-week golden-baseline update, strict rerun, and independent historian/canon review all passed. The 52-week cascade improves the core anchor gate from 30/31 to 31/31 while leaving six bot bands green, critical anomalies at zero, and warnings unchanged at three. The still-unsupported source/prose is an explicit R7 remediation row, not a reason to restore the territorial mutation. Evidence: [implementation report](../40_reports/implemented/20260801_R6_GORAZDE_CURRENT_STATE_TRUTH.md).

### 2026-08-01 R7 Phase 0 inventory completion amendment

All four deterministic R7 inventory families are present. The identity/audio packet inventories 374/374 officer/OOB rows and 36/36 audio cues without inventing evidence. The historical/localization packet adds 406 owner-routed claims, zero event/essay year mismatches, passing September-1993 Neretva/Grabovica/Uzdol anchors, 5,542 EN keys, and one explicit Bosnian fallback. R7 remains in progress for the finite historical/source, identity, `bs` migration, pseudo-locale, native review, licensing/audio, accessibility, and packaged-Electron remediation queues. Evidence: [historical/localization audit](../40_reports/audits/20260801_R7_HISTORICAL_CLAIM_LOCALIZATION_INVENTORIES.md) and [identity/audio audit](../40_reports/audits/20260801_R7_OFFICER_AUDIO_PROVENANCE_INVENTORY.md).

### 2026-08-01 R5 Phase 2 checkpoint amendment

R5 Phases 0 and 1 are complete. Three independently reviewed Phase 2 reuse checkpoints are accepted: operational graph, runtime-hardened immutable adjacency, and caller-owned operational data. The turn-local final-sector receipt checkpoint is now correctness-repaired after committee review found mixed-receipt stage masking and unreported roster location writebacks. Focused 69/69 and expanded 105/105 tests pass, and the corrected warmup/profile/three-run packet remains byte-identical at 5,071,275 bytes and SHA-256 `52ee1829aab62e5ede80ca461b0ec6cc1d5ecc8ac2e0700a36ea7229d6050bde`. Corrected timing is not accepted: mean 1,588.219 ms/turn (P50 1,616.182; P95 1,654.908) is 18.155% slower than the prior receipt packet and 17.819% slower than its prior control. The accepted best throughput floor remains 1,189.962 ms/turn (11.8996x the 100 ms target). Committee re-review and measured performance recovery precede topology convergence; R5 Phase 2 and the workstream remain open.

### 2026-08-01 R1 closure amendment

R1 is closed locally after independent approval and three layers of evidence. The authoritative 72-sample performance artifact records cold current-state p50/p95 70.7/78.8 ms and warm interactive p50/p95 114.45/139.515 ms; all warm cycles create/release zero MapLibre/Deck owners and request zero static resources. The supplemental three-launch player packet proves actual camera movement, exact formation/settlement inspection, hidden-map input exclusion, catalog-backed historical-default choice, visible Advance, neutral/read-only post-advance handling, exact current-turn/fingerprint truth, unchanged repository saves, clean diagnostics, and verified process exit. Task 4.3 optional module splitting was not eligible because cold p95 had already passed at 125.2 ms after Phase 3. R2 may now rebase its shared map/shell files on R1. Evidence and full scope: [implementation report](../40_reports/implemented/20260801_SEAMLESS_COMMAND_ROOM_MAP_TRANSITION.md).

### 2026-08-01 R2 source-closeout amendment

All six R2 source packets are implemented and independently reviewed. FR-03 now routes the exact historical-operation dossier through the retained current-revision tactical map, exact objective/staging/participant evidence, and back to the same dossier without map-side authorization or renderer churn. FR-06 now uses full semantic labels, one chip plus deterministic `+N` below 1600 px and at most two plus `+N` above it, with complete accessible popover truth. Rejected packaged runs reached turn 104 but exposed retired stack-badge, post-Army-HQ route-restoration, and adaptive counter-target harness defects; all remain negative evidence. The repaired harness emits an explicit stack not-applicable receipt, restores the exact current-revision War Map before field toolbar use, freezes counter proof to its declared initial identities, and measures document/strip/OOB/Situation/branch geometry. R2 remains open until a new package and fresh no-resume RS run complete with clean final diagnostics and materialized geometry receipts. Evidence and exact scope: [source closeout report](../40_reports/implemented/20260801_R2_RS_FRICTION_FR03_FR06_AND_RUNTIME_HARDENING.md).

## 6. Locked Product and Historical Decisions

### 6.1 Presidential role and cadence

- The final player command model has five levers. Do not add a sixth.
- The Decision Room is the only action owner. The Desk triages; map/Army HQ supplies evidence; Chronicle, Cost Ledger, and Codex hold receipts.
- The president does not assign brigades, draw axes, select tactical targets, or manage operational timing.
- A quiet week may be a truthful positive hold. It is better than a fabricated choice.
- Optional initiatives require a cited authored row, deterministic conditions, an existing presidential lever, a once/cooldown rule, and non-blocking presentation.
- The former “Free War” residual is absorbed into R4 as event/command/Codex texture; it is not a new system or lever.

### 6.2 Tactical and Standing Operational Groups

- `CorpsOperation.phase` is the sole offensive lifecycle clock.
- Donor-backed Tactical Groups are the only new offensive task-organization path; legacy `kind: 'og'` production becomes compatibility-only.
- Phase 3 constants are final: maximum 12 turns, cohesion drain 4 per engaged turn, dissolve at cohesion 15, Army-HQ cap recovery tail 4 turns.
- Promotion identities require an explicit verified `(corps_id, ordinal) -> division_number` mapping. Unknown means no promotion, never a guessed number.
- Corps sectors remain standing OGs. Actual contributors share the immediate combat cost already produced by the live path; downstream aftermath remains primarily owned by the primary defender.
- ADR-0007 Phase C stays retired. R3 aligns ADR-0006/0007, the Systems Manual, and Rulebook to live behavior; it does not resurrect broader shared defense.

### 6.3 Behavior experiments

- Political-dimension isolation runs `intl_only` first, then `cohesion_only`. Each is adopted only if its predeclared historical and engine-health bounds pass; otherwise it is retired.
- Intel ambush runs only after the combat floor is stable and is adopted or retired by the R6 criteria.
- Supply work improves comprehension only. It creates no new presidential authority and reveals no hidden enemy truth.
- Sarajevo becomes a continuous supply/lifeline condition. It is not an atrocity-management lever.
- Fall 1995: E-A5 is already shipped; implement E-B1. Add E-A6 only if the post-E-B1 residual evidence still requires it; otherwise retire E-A6.
- Failed experiments leave a report, removed/reverted implementation, and a closed no-go row. They do not wait for another owner decision.

### 6.4 Sensitive history and chronology

- Sensitive outcomes are informational consequences, not player choices or optimization rewards.
- Every claim uses the source hierarchy and claim ledger in R7. Unsupported claims are omitted.
- Named officer/OOB identities require exact sourced mappings. Unknown identities are omitted, not inferred.
- Zvornik and Foča takeover chronology belongs to April 1992. Neretva/Grabovica/Uzdol belongs to 1993; Uzdol is dated 14 September 1993 in the local source extraction. No June-1992 fallback may carry those 1993 events.
- Sarajevo history is bounded by tribunal evidence; Srebrenica content is bounded by tribunal and UN evidence.

### 6.5 Localization and audio

- Canonical Bosnian locale is `bs`; formatting uses `bs-BA`. Legacy `bcs` preferences migrate/alias to `bs`.
- Pseudolocalization and automated completeness checks run before visual LQA.
- If native review is unavailable, English remains default and Bosnian is visibly labeled “Preview”; lack of a reviewer does not block all other work.
- Audio priority: first-party/generated UI sound, then CC0, then explicitly approved CC BY with title/author/source/license and checksum.
- Do not use CC BY-NC, unverified anthem/folk recordings, speeches, screams, or gunfire/atrocity spectacle.

### 6.6 Map, Electron, and release architecture

- Measure cold and warm map entry before optimizing.
- Keep campaign-scoped map renderers mounted; visibility is not lifecycle.
- Cache immutable static resources per renderer session; current campaign/control/decision/fog truth remains live.
- Defer noncritical enrichment until after the meaningful current-state frame.
- Preserve Electron isolation/security while optimizing; never trade security for startup time.
- Steam is the primary store. Direct artifacts are signed Windows, notarized macOS, and Linux AppImage.
- Windows signing uses Microsoft Artifact Signing/SignTool; macOS uses Developer ID and `notarytool`.
- Credentials are secure injected inputs, never repository content or a reason to leave product planning unresolved.

## 7. Experiment Outcome Matrix

| Experiment | Adopt when | Retire when | Always preserve |
|---|---|---|---|
| Political `intl_only` | Historical direction, faction separation, engine health, determinism, and control/casualty bounds all pass the R6 thresholds | Any hard criterion fails or the effect is materially redundant | Recorded seed/config/baseline and a concise result report |
| Political `cohesion_only` | Same criteria, evaluated only after the first branch is dispositioned | Same failure rule | Same evidence |
| Intel ambush | Adds readable uncertainty and historically plausible cost without hidden-truth leakage or destabilizing calibration | Fails comprehension, determinism, or historical/calibration bounds | Focused test/report and clean revert |
| Fall-1995 E-A6 | E-B1 evidence leaves the exact named residual and E-A6 corrects it without breaking other bounds | E-B1 closes the residual or E-A6 causes collateral drift | E-B1 remains; E-A6 row closes as not needed |
| Performance optimization | Profiled bottleneck improves materially and byte/state/render truth is unchanged | Noise, regression, stale truth, or complexity exceeds benefit | Characterization and before/after measurements |
| Sourced cadence initiative | Source, existing lever, deterministic eligibility, optionality, and cadence value all pass | No source-backed lever exists | Explicit positive-hold interval |

No experiment remains “partial” after evaluation.

## 8. Cross-Workstream Collision Rules

| Shared surface | Ownership order |
|---|---|
| `App.tsx`, `MapContainer.tsx`, `shellNavigation.ts`, `gameStore.ts` | R1 first; R2 FR-03 rebases on R1. |
| Decision priority/cadence read models and authored initiatives | R2 first; R4 consumes and generalizes the accepted contract. |
| Tactical Group/GameState lifecycle | R3 first; R5 persistence work rebases on R3 schema. |
| Combat resolution and calibration | R3 floor, then R5 stability proof, then R6 experiments serially. |
| Event/essay authored rows | R4 inventory/convergence first; R7 attribution/content pass second. |
| Map/Desk layout strings | R1/R2 layout first; R7 localization sweep second. |
| Package/release configuration | R8 may create transient local validation builds; R9 owns release configuration and immutable RC artifacts. |

Before each workstream:

1. inspect `git status --short`, current branch, and worktrees;
2. inspect the preceding workstream closeout and shared-file diff;
3. rebase/merge only through normal non-destructive Git operations;
4. update the master and command board together if evidence changes ordering;
5. never delete, clean, reset, or overwrite an unrelated dirty worktree.

## 9. Legacy 30-Lane Disposition

The former command board had duplicate, closed, paused, and owner-gated rows. Every row now has one finite home.

| # | Former lane | Disposition |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Seamless map transition | R1 |
| 2 | Operational/Tactical Group closeout | R3 |
| 3 | Presidential Command Model | R4 |
| 4 | Presidential Surface | Closed foundation; R4 regression coverage only |
| 5 | Free War | Absorbed into R4 texture/cadence; no new system |
| 6 | Branch protection / CI / release blockers | R5 CI parity and R9 release proof |
| 7 | GUI polish | Closed foundation; new diary findings route through R2/R8 |
| 8 | Army-arc calibration | Closed historical packet; final bounded calibration belongs to R6 |
| 9 | Standing OG no-go | R3 doctrine convergence; R6 preserves Phase C retirement |
| 10 | Tactical Groups duplicate row | Merged into R3 |
| 11 | Event core | R4 |
| 12 | Dynamic Codex | R4 |
| 13 | Optional GameState cleanup | R5 |
| 14 | Sector performance | R5 |
| 15 | Save/load/replay determinism | R5 |
| 16 | Bosnian localization/LQA | R7 |
| 17 | Casualty model | Closed foundation; R6 regression only |
| 18 | Intel ambush | R6 adopt-or-retire experiment |
| 19 | Supply comprehension | R6 explanation-only slice |
| 20 | Officer/OOB depth | R7 exact-source inventory |
| 21 | Soundscape | R7 licensed bounded audio |
| 22 | Telemetry/playtest | R8 |
| 23 | Cohesion divisor | Closed; retained as regression |
| 24 | Political dimensions | R6 serialized adopt-or-retire experiments |
| 25 | Patron/military credibility | Closed; R4/R6 regression only |
| 26 | Ring 3 content | R7 |
| 27 | Sarajevo continuous condition | R6 |
| 28 | Packaging/signing/store/press/trailer | R9 |
| 29 | FORAWWV owner decisions | Waiting lane retired; decisions are locked here; FORAWWV remains untouched |
| 30 | Fall-1995 combat | R6 E-B1, then evidence-conditional E-A6 |

Closed rows are not carried as active status rows. Their history lives in Git, the ledger, and implementation reports.

## 10. Finding Routing

During R8 and R9:

| Finding | Route |
|---|---|
| Incorrect result, broken control, crash, diagnostic error, stale save/map truth, determinism or migration failure | **Bug** -> owning R1–R7 plan -> fix/test -> restart affected fresh campaign |
| Understandable but slow, unclear, repetitive, badly prioritized, or unpolished flow | **Friction** -> R2 for Desk/Decision/map loop, R4 for command/event truth, R7 for content/localization/audio, otherwise owning lane |
| Historically unsupported or misplaced content | **Bug** if factual/chronological; **friction** if sourcing is correct but presentation is unclear -> R6/R7 |
| Optional improvement outside 1.0 outcome and not required for 5/5 | Record in post-1.0 backlog; do not expand this roadmap |

Bugs are fixed before friction. A repaired packaged-Electron session restarts from a clean campaign; it is never continued across a source-changing fix.

## 11. Global Verification Barriers

Each plan contains focused commands. Before a workstream closes, run its focused suite plus every applicable global command:

```powershell
npm.cmd run typecheck
npm.cmd run canon:check
npm.cmd run test:baselines
npm.cmd run engine:health:gate
npm.cmd run test:vitest -- --pool=forks --reporter=dot
git diff --check
```

Additional rules:

- Run two byte-identical long scenarios after any deterministic simulation/output change.
- Run save migration and round-trip tests after any persisted-state change.
- Run packaged/local-Electron console, network, renderer, WebGL, accessibility, and screenshot proof after player-facing or shell changes.
- Do not refresh a baseline until the changed behavior is explained, accepted by this roadmap’s locked criteria, and recorded in the ledger.
- Test commands must pass from the documented supported Windows entrypoint.
- R9 adds clean-machine, malware/security, license/SBOM, checksum, signing/notarization, install/uninstall, offline-start, store-depot, and rollback proof.

## 12. Definition of Program Completion

The roadmap is complete only when:

- R1–R7 acceptance criteria and plan checklists are green;
- R8 completes fresh full-duration RBiH, RS, and HRHB coverage and the final two owner-style diaries score 5/5;
- every R8 finding is either fixed and reverified or explicitly proven outside the 1.0 definition of done;
- bugs and friction remain separately reported;
- deterministic, migration, canon, accessibility, security, and clean-runtime barriers are green;
- R9 creates a reproducible immutable RC and complete publication packet;
- the command board, plan index, documentation index, ledger, and knowledge ledger match this state;
- no stale active lane, duplicate plan, unresolved design choice, or unexplained baseline drift remains.

Public release is complete only after the owner separately says `Publish 1.0` and the R9 signing/upload/tag/push steps succeed.

## 13. Orchestrator Closeout Contract

For each workstream, the orchestrator records:

```text
Workstream:
Plan:
Base and final commit:
Tasks completed:
Focused verification:
Long-run/package evidence:
Behavior/baseline disposition:
Historical/source review:
Bug findings:
Friction findings:
Ledger/canon/docs propagation:
Remaining dependency:
Next workstream:
```

At program close, append one final ledger entry, link the R8 diaries and R9 manifest, mark R1–R9 complete here and on the command board, and run the full verification set. Do not publish implicitly.

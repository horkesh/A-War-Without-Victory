## HISTORICAL CONTEXT

**Timeline Leading to This Date:**
- **March 1, 1992:** BiH independence referendum (boycotted by Serbs)
- **March 18, 1992:** Lisbon Agreement signed (later rejected)
- **March 31, 1992:** Bijeljina incident - Arkan's paramilitary seizes town
- **April 4, 1992:** Siege of Sarajevo begins (informal)
- **April 6, 1992:** EU and US recognize BiH independence
- **April 6, 1992:** War formally begins, Serb attacks across BiH
- **April 8-10, 1992:** Zvornik falls to VRS/JNA and paramilitaries
- **April 15, 1992:** THIS SCENARIO DATE

**Strategic Situation:**
The war is nine days old. The Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and Bosnian Serb Territorial Defense forces, coordinating as proto-VRS, are conducting lightning offensives to seize strategic territory and create ethnically-defined Republika Srpska. The Bosnian government possesses almost no military capability—only lightly armed Territorial Defense units, police, and volunteers with hunting rifles. The Croatian Defense Council (HVO) is establishing control in Croat-majority areas with an ambiguous strategy: sometimes cooperating with ARBiH against VRS, sometimes cooperating with VRS against ARBiH.

The international arms embargo is in effect, preventing the ARBiH from acquiring heavy weapons. VRS/JNA forces are capturing towns through coordinated attacks combining regular JNA units, Bosnian Serb TO, and paramilitary groups (Arkan's Tigers, White Eagles). Ethnic cleansing is beginning in captured areas.

## STRATEGIC SITUATION APRIL 15, 1992

### Territorial Control Estimate:
- **VRS/JNA:** ~30-40% and expanding rapidly
- **ARBiH:** ~25-35% (fragmented, cities and pockets)
- **HVO:** ~10-12% (Croat-majority areas)
- **Contested:** ~20-30%

**Trend:** VRS offensive succeeding, will control ~70% by December 1992

### Exhaustion Levels:
- **VRS:** LOW (10-20%) - Offensive momentum, achieving objectives
- **ARBiH:** MODERATE-HIGH (30-40%) - Desperate defense, ammunition critical
- **HVO:** LOW (10-20%) - Establishing positions

### Supply States:
- **VRS:** ABUNDANT - JNA stockpiles, Serbian support unlimited
- **ARBiH:** CATASTROPHIC - Arms embargo, minimal ammunition, no heavy weapons
- **HVO:** ADEQUATE - Croatian supply lines functional

### International Context:
- **UN Arms Embargo:** In effect, prevents ARBiH from acquiring weapons legally
- **EU/US Recognition:** BiH recognized April 6, but no military support
- **UNPROFOR:** Not yet deployed in BiH (in Croatia only)
- **International Response:** Condemnation of violence, no intervention

### Key Strategic Dynamics:

**VRS Offensive Operations:**
- Systematic campaign to seize ~70% of BiH territory
- Ethnic cleansing coordinated with military operations
- JNA support (artillery from Serbia, heavy weapons transfer)
- Professional officers, superior firepower
- Objective: Create ethnically-defined Republika Srpska

**ARBiH Desperate Defense:**
- Building army while under attack
- No heavy weapons, no air defense
- Ammunition exhaustion imminent in many areas
- Arms embargo preventing resupply
- High morale but minimal capability
- Fragmented territory (isolated pockets)

**HVO Strategic Ambiguity:**
- Unclear strategy: Ally or rival to ARBiH?
- Cooperation in some areas (Posavina)
- Competition/hostility in others (Kupres, Central Bosnia)
- Croatian agenda: Herzeg-Bosnia entity
- Better equipped than ARBiH

**Ethnic Cleansing:**
- Systematic in VRS-captured areas
- Concentration camps establishing (Prijedor: Omarska, Keraterm)
- Paramilitaries conducting massacres
- Refugee flows: Muslims fleeing to ARBiH-held areas

## HISTORICAL VALIDATION ANCHORS

To test simulation accuracy for April 15, 1992:

1. **Zvornik** must show VRS control (captured April 8-10)
2. **Bijeljina** must show VRS control (captured March 31)
3. **Srebrenica** must show ARBiH/local defense holding (under pressure)
4. **SAPNA** must show ARBiH local defense HOLDING (critical test)
5. **Goražde** must show ARBiH holding, VRS siege beginning
6. **Sarajevo** must show ARBiH holding city center, VRS surrounding
7. **Bihać** must show ARBiH isolated pocket
8. **Tuzla** must show ARBiH controlled
9. **Zenica** must show ARBiH controlled
10. **Banja Luka** must show VRS firm control
11. **Mostar** must show beginning division (west HVO, east ARBiH forming)
12. **Brčko** must show contested, heavy fighting
13. **Kupres** must show HVO/VRS cooperation to capture from ARBiH
14. **VRS** must control ~30-40% territory (expanding to ~70% by Dec 1992)
15. **ARBiH** must have almost no heavy weapons
16. **HVO 107th, 108th brigades** must show cooperation with ARBiH in northeastern Bosnia

## INFERENCE RULES FOR AGENT

For settlements not explicitly specified, the agent should use:

1. **1991 Census Data:** Ethnic composition baseline
2. **Regional Patterns:** 
   - Drina Valley: VRS controls main roads and towns, Muslims in pockets
   - Posavina: VRS offensive ongoing
   - Northwestern BiH: VRS firm control (Banja Luka region)
   - Northeastern BiH: ARBiH controls Tuzla-Gradačac line
   - Central Bosnia: Mixed ARBiH/HVO
   - Eastern Herzegovina: VRS controlled
   - Western Herzegovina: HVO controlled

3. **Proximity to Frontlines:** Settlements near explicitly mentioned locations follow same control pattern

4. **Ethnic Majority Heuristic:**
   - 80%+ Serb + VRS regional control = VRS controlled
   - 70%+ Muslim + ARBiH regional control = ARBiH controlled
   - 70%+ Croat + HVO regional control = HVO controlled
   - Mixed areas + regional pattern = Contested or aligns with regional controller

5. **Strategic Importance:** Roads, railways, river crossings prioritized by VRS

6. **Exceptions:** Small Muslim/Croat-majority villages in VRS-controlled regions likely captured/ethnically cleansed by April 15

## SCENARIO END CONDITIONS

This scenario represents April 15, 1992. The simulation should model:

**VRS:**
- Continuing offensive operations
- Objective: Secure ~70% territory by end 1992
- Ethnic cleansing systematic
- Superior firepower

**ARBiH:**
- Desperate defense
- Critical ammunition shortages
- Building corps structures
- No heavy weapons

**HVO:**
- Establishing control in Croat areas
- Strategic ambiguity (ally or rival?)
- Better equipped than ARBiH

**Next Scenario:** December 15, 1992 (VRS at maximum extent ~70%)

## Validation anchors (game assertions)

Testable at scenario date when per-scenario or municipality-level init is used:

- **zvornik:** `controllers_by_mun1990_id['zvornik'] === 'RS'` (Zvornik fell April 8-10).
- **bijeljina:** `controllers_by_mun1990_id['bijeljina'] === 'RS'`.
- **bratunac,** **vlasenica:** RS (captured early/mid April).
- **srebrenica:** RBiH (enclave holding).
- **Sapna area:** All settlements in Sapna (post-1995; see SCENARIO_GAME_MAPPING) have `political_controller === 'RBiH'` when settlement-level or scenario-specific data exists.
- **gorazde** (`gorazde`): RBiH (enclave holding).
- Key Posavina: e.g. **bosanski_samac** → RS; **orasje** → HRHB; **brcko** contested (game may use single controller per mun).

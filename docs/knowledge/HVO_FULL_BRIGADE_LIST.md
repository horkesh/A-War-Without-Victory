### Note on sources

HVO had no dedicated Appendix in Balkan Battlegrounds Vol. I. This list is derived from the HVO OOB master (narrative + vojska.net). Some brigade HQs are inferred from "Base" or area control; where only "narrative" or "see OOB master" appears, the exact HQ was not given in standardized form.

**Southeast Herzegovina "narrative" brigades (103rd–106th, Kralj Petar Krešimir IV, Ban Jelačić, Herceg Stjepan, Mario Hrkač Čikota, 6th "Ranko Boban"):** These brigades are mentioned in historical sources but lack precise municipality and HQ data in available documentation. Further research from vojska.net archives, ICTY testimony, or Croatian military archives may be required for full detail.

## Game alignment

- The corps, brigades, and strength figures in this document are **narrative and research** only. The formation system in game state (`FormationState` in `src/state/game_state.ts`) is **not** yet populated from these OOBs.
- All VRS forces map to game faction **`RS`** (e.g. 1st Krajina Corps → RS, Drina Corps → RS). When formation authoring is implemented, this document is the reference for VRS formations. See `docs/knowledge/SCENARIO_GAME_MAPPING.md` for faction and control value mapping.

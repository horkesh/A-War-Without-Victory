In 2020, UNDP launched the implementation of the Strengthening the Role of Local Communities/Mjesne zajednice in Bosnia and Herzegovina Project, Phase 2 (MZ Project) jointly financed by the Government of Switzerland and Sweden. The overall goal of the second Project phase is to improve the quality of life of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina through empowered, gender responsive local communities (MZs) that facilitate active citizen engagement in public life, stand for people-centered performance of local governments and catalyze democratic transformation at the local level. 

The key Project stakeholders are the following 41 Local Governments (LGs): Banja Luka, Bihać, Bijeljina, Brčko distrikt, Breza, Centar Sarajevo, Čitluk, Doboj, Goražde, Gračanica, Gradačac, Gradiška, Ilijaš, Jablanica, Ključ, Kotor Varoš, Laktaši, Ljubinje, Ljubuški, Maglaj, Modriča, Mrkonjić Grad, Nevesinje, Olovo, Pale FBiH, Petrovo, Rogatica, Rudo, Sanski Most, Tešanj, Teslić, Trebinje, Trnovo, Višegrad, Visoko, Vitez, Vlasenica, Vogošća, Zavidovići, Zenica, Žepče.

This event will consist of an interactive fair to showcase project outcomes and engage the public, followed by a recognition ceremony to honor outstanding community contributions.

**Assistant**

Pregledao sam ToR i vidim da već uključuje razvoj koncepta, podršku u pripremi ToR-a za RfQ, praćenje rada odabrane firme i izvještavanje. Ako želimo povećati vrijednost ugovora za 20%, to treba pravdati dodatnim zadacima koji značajno doprinose kvaliteti i uspjehu događaja.  

Predlažem sljedeće nove stavke:  

### 1. Moderiranje oba događaja (glavni dodatak)  
- **Moderiranje interaktivnog sajma** – vođenje programa, uvodna i završna obraćanja, facilitacija panel diskusije.  
- **Moderiranje ceremonije dodjele priznanja** – najava govornika, vođenje kroz program, vođenje dijela sa dodjelom nagrada.  

### 2. Dodatne predložene stavke  
- **Priprema govora i skripti za moderiranje**: izrada scenarija, koordinacija sa govornicima, prijedlog dinamike događaja.  
- **Trening za govornike/paneliste**: kratka sesija s izabranim panelistima i nagrađenima radi pripreme za javni nastup.  
- **After-event komunikacijski izvještaj**: analiza vidljivosti, kvalitetna evaluacija medijskog dosega i preporuke za buduće slične događaje.  

### Kako ih ugraditi u ToR  
- Dodati **Task 5: Moderation and On-site Facilitation**, sa 5 dodatnih dana (2 za pripremu + 3 za moderiranje i facilitaciju).  
- U deliverables uključiti: *scenariji za oba događaja, vođenje oba događaja, evaluacija učinka moderiranja.*  
- Ukupni angažman bi porastao sa 30 na 35 dana (otprilike 15–20% više), što se uklapa u povećanje vrijednosti ugovora koje tražite.  

Želite li da vam odmah pripremim ažuriranu verziju ToR-a sa uključenim novim **Task 5** i prilagođenom tabelom deliverables/output?

Želite li da vam odmah formatiram i ažuriranu tabelu deliverables/outputs u kojoj je ovaj Task 5 uključen sa danima i procentima, umjesto da to ručno radite?
---

**User**

You can't have 3 days for moderation of a one day event.
---

**Assistant**

Odlično zapažanje 👍 – potpuno ste u pravu. Ako je događaj jednodnevni (sajam + ceremonija istog dana), nema smisla predvidjeti 3 dana za samo moderiranje. Predlažem ovako:

Želite li da ovaj **Task 5** preformulišem tako da povećanje ukupne vrijednosti ugovora i dalje dođe do cca 20% (npr. dodavanjem još jedne manje stavke poput mini-treninga govornika ili after-event komunikacijskog izvještaja)?
---

**User**

Da trebaće mi i task 6 izgleda. Može trening govornika, kao i after izvještaj.
---

**Assistant**

Super ✔️, evo prijedloga za **Task 6**, koji može pokriti i mini-trening govornika i after-event izvještaj:

👉 Kombinacijom **Task 5 (3 dana, 10%)** i **Task 6 (2 dana, 5%)**, ukupni angažman bi rastao sa 30 na **35 dana**, a vrijednost ugovora povećala se za oko **17%**. Ako želite tačno 20%, možemo proširiti Task 6 (npr. dodati još jedan dan za detaljniju medijsku analizu ili follow-up s medijima).  

Želite li da vam sad sastavim i ažuriranu tabelu deliverables/outputs sa svih 6 taskova i novim procentima?

**User**

OK now I need a justification on why we elected her to be moderator. Something along the line of how she delved deep into project during her work on other tasks etc etc. Two sentences.
---

**Assistant**

Here’s a concise justification you can use:  

She was selected to moderate the final event given her in-depth engagement with the project while developing the event concept, drafting procurement documents, and supporting execution. This extensive involvement allowed her to gain a comprehensive understanding of project priorities, stakeholders, and communication objectives, ensuring that she can guide the event with authority and coherence.  

👉 Želite li da ovo pripremim i na bosanskom jeziku, za internu upotrebu?
---

**User**

Don't use the phrase "She was selected." Rather something like "Her in-depth engagement led us to..." Also, she has prior moderating experience.
---

**Assistant**

Got it 👍 — here’s a refined two-sentence justification:  

Her in-depth engagement with the project through concept development, procurement support, and execution oversight led us to entrust her with moderating the final event. Combined with her prior moderating experience, this ensures both a deep understanding of project content and a professional delivery of the programme.  

Želite li da pripremim i kraću verziju za eventualnu upotrebu u zvaničnom saopštenju (više “public-facing” ton)?

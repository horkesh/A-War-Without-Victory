CHAPTER 4 – FINANCES AND MANAGEMENT

According to the cost extension agreed in December 2024, the total expected budget for the Project Phase II has been increased by an additional USD 196,364.00 from the Government of Switzerland and parallel contributions from BIH authorities. The total planned project budget now amounts to USD 11,008,544.83 and consists of:

USD 5,351,364.00 representing the contribution of the Government of Switzerland 

USD 2,858,017.76 (equivalent to SEK 28,000,000 in April 2020) representing the contribution of the Government of Sweden 

USD 21,359.89 representing the contribution of the International Fund for Animal Welfare 

USD 37,117.59 representing the contribution of the Dogs Trust BIH Foundation (equivalent to BAM 68,036.55 in December 2023) 

USD 52,793.50 representing the contribution of UNDP 

USD 2,687,892.09 representing the parallel contribution of the BIH authorities

By the end 2024, all planned funds were received. Due to exchange rate losses, the actual contribution from the Government of Sweden amounted to USD 2,734,936.64, approximately USD 123,081.12 lower than planned. Similarly, the actual contribution from the Dogs Trust BIH Foundation was USD 37,520.12, instead of the initially anticipated USD 37,117.59. This shortfall in contributions will be addressed through a revision of the project budget in 2025.  The remaining instalment of USD 196,364.00 from the Government of Switzerland is planned to be received by the end of March 2025. The budget balance on 31st December 2023 was USD 2,293,181.93 (including envisaged local governments contributions of USD 484,239.63). The total expenditure for the period from 1st January until 31st December 2024 is USD 1,856,080.89, out of which there was an additional contribution from local governments of USD 150,984.55. The total Project expenditure for the period 1st March 2020 until 31st December 2024 is USD 10,100,840.06 (including local governments contributions in the amount of USD 2,518,830.28).  

These figures are still the subject of possible minor changes since the final formal finance data are not yet available. 



Management 

Project activities in 2024 required constant adaptation to the issues in relation to locally led public procurement processes, that often resulted in higher than expected offers for the procured services and goods. The challenges have been overcome through constant communication with local governments, their willingness to increase the co-financing, when needed, and the flexibility of the Project. A slow transition from service provider mode toward implementation by the project staff, who has adequate skills and knowledge, was fully implemented. The project staff gradually taking more proactive role and direct responsibilities, responding on tasks out of their initially planned terms of responsibilities. 

Additional funding secured by Dogs Trust Worldwide Foundation Bosnia enabled the Project for further building on joint achievements in systemic addressing the issue of roaming dogs. That issue was identified as a priority at the local level in some partner municipalities, but also in additional municipalities that requested immediate and urgent direct support (Vareš). Via the secured additional funding, the MZ Project directly work in the Humane Community Development (HCD) issues in 7 municipalities and cities, aiming for better and safer communities for people and animals.  

In 2024, the MZ Project sustained its communication efforts, releasing the November 2024 MZ Newsletter to keep communities informed. After focusing on social media in 2023, the Project turned to in-person events in 2024 to promote its role in revitalizing local community (MZ) functions. The year started with six live events featuring panel discussions across BiH cities, drawing approximately 180 participants. Mid-year, two outdoor events in Banja Luka and Sarajevo further expanded its visibility. Having in mind the approved Project extension, the Final Event was rescheduled for 2025. 

Media coverage included 417 mentions in 2024 across print, electronic, and online platforms in BiH. While below the 566 mentions of 2023, this figure more than doubles the 198 mentions from 2021, showing sustained growth. On social media, the Project posted 64 times on UNDP BiH channels, a notable increase from 39 in 2023 and 27 in 2022, enhancing its digital reach.

The Final Project Evaluation, conducted in 2024, showcases that the Project demonstrated significant progress in empowering MZs and improving local governance. Based on the evaluation findings, the project successfully enhanced citizens' trust in local institutions, promoted gender equality and social inclusion, and supported the development of local governance structures. Key achievements include the adoption of gender-sensitive legislative frameworks, increased citizen participation, and the revitalization of local infrastructure. Despite the challenging socio-political context, the project’s approach was highly relevant, and stakeholder satisfaction was over 95%.

However, the evaluation also highlights several challenges. While the project has made significant strides in creating a foundation for long-term community development, the continued success of these initiatives will depend on local governments' ability to secure financial resources, maintain citizen engagement, and overcome political and institutional barriers. Overall, the project has had a positive impact, but further support and strategic planning will be necessary to ensure the sustainability of its results. The evaluation recommendations were included in the management response, a standardized UNDP management tool. 

Through a mix of engaging events, consistent media presence, and a growing social media footprint, the MZ Project in 2024 continued to strengthen local communities throughout BiH. During 2024th, the project faced new team composition challenges, with the project associate, project assistant and one field officer leaving in Q4 2024. This staff optimisation and overall rigid project finance execution, together with additional funding from Switzerland, allowed the extension of the project by September 2025. After a long discussions and intensive negotiations, the cost extension was approved in December 2024. Additional staff reduction and the Project optimisation expected in Q2 2025.

MZ Project in 2025

New activities in 2025

Leadership Trainings

In February 2025, the Project held a Training of Trainers (ToT) for local leadership, equipping 40 local government representatives (57.5% men, 42.5% women) with knowledge on topics such as legal frameworks, MZ methodology, citizen forums, and the role of community centers. The ToT aimed to strengthen local decision-making capacity and enable knowledge transfer to mayors and councilors. Based on the ToT materials, an external consultant developed a 4-hour training program for newly elected decision-makers to help them effectively support local communities.

Supported by the AMCRS and AMC FBiH, the Project also organized 8 trainings for newly elected officials, with 99 participants (54 men, 45 women) from various locations, aiming to strengthen their leadership skills and promote transparency in local governance.



The final event

The final event of the project “Strengthening the Role of Local Communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina” took place on 3 September 2025 in Sarajevo, successfully marking the completion of a multi-year initiative aimed at promoting citizen participation, inclusive governance, and stronger partnerships among local communities, authorities, and development actors. The event combined an interactive festival with a formal recognition ceremony, offering both celebration and reflection on the project’s achievements. 

Originally planned as an outdoor event, the festival had to be relocated due to adverse weather conditions. The International Center for Children and Youth Novo Sarajevo was secured as the new venue, and the transition was managed swiftly and professionally, ensuring that the program proceeded smoothly. The event gathered a large number of citizens who actively participated in the fair and its activities, demonstrating strong interest in local initiatives. Representatives of municipal administrations, donor organizations, and implementing partners were also present, underscoring the importance of the festival as a space for dialogue, recognition, and partnership.

To ensure strong visibility and outreach, a comprehensive social media campaign accompanied the event on Facebook and Instagram. The campaign ran from 20 August to 2 September 2025, supported by fifteen story countdowns and real-time event coverage. It reached a total of 393,673 users. Most of the reach was generated through Facebook (over 300,000 users), while Instagram accounted for around 90,000. Engagement levels were particularly strong among users aged 25–34, 35–44, and 55–64, with an almost even gender distribution. The key visual messages — “Our local community, our strength,” “Together we drive change,” and “Citizens are changing their MZs” — were widely shared and resonated strongly with the audience.

Three short promotional videos were produced and promoted as part of the campaign. Altogether, they reached more than 44,000 users, with 106,271 ThruPlays and nearly 120,000 views, most of which came from women aged 45–64 in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The videos effectively conveyed the spirit of the project, showcasing citizen engagement, local leadership, and community transformation. In addition, fifteen story posts were shared live during the festival, maintaining steady audience interaction through comments, shares, and reactions.

Media coverage further amplified the event’s visibility. A total of fifteen articles were published across national, regional, and local outlets, including Klix.ba, Poslovne Novine, Nezavisne novine (print and online), TVK3, and several local radio stations and municipal portals. Although the numerical target for media coverage was slightly below plan, the achieved visibility was diverse and of high quality, with several stories emphasizing the project’s decade-long contribution to strengthening local communities and citizen engagement throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. The coverage also highlighted the achievements of individual municipalities and recognized citizens who had played key roles in implementing local initiatives.

Overall, the final event exceeded expectations in both participation and outreach. Attendance was strong despite logistical challenges, and the event atmosphere reflected genuine community pride and ownership of results. The communication campaign delivered outstanding outcomes, with nearly 400,000 people reached, more than 119,000 video views, and broad social media engagement, surpassing the KPIs defined in the Terms of Reference.

The festival in Sarajevo demonstrated the tangible results of sustained investment in participatory local governance. It showcased how citizens, when supported by responsive local authorities and development partners, can drive meaningful and lasting change within their communities. By bringing together diverse stakeholders, recognizing achievements, and celebrating collaboration, the event provided a fitting conclusion to a transformative project that reaffirmed one clear message: the strength of Bosnia and Herzegovina lies in its local communities and the citizens who continue to shape them.



The event was a platform to promote the best and most active partners, such are: 

 1.  Outstanding Community Hub, CH Dobropolje-Mekiš, Tešanj

The Community Hub Dobropolje-Mekiš, Tešanj, reconstructed through the project “Strengthening the Role of Local Communities in BiH”, has become a hub for citizens of all generations. It hosts diverse activities, including educational workshops, cultural events, lectures, panel discussions, fitness and art programs, youth gatherings, and social initiatives. Participants range from children and youth to women, pensioners, volunteers, and educators.

The Community Hub is now a recognized space for learning, socializing, and civic engagement, fostering mutual support, knowledge exchange, community spirit, and active participation, enriching the lives of residents. Emina Brka, community hub`s manager, successfully finished a series of trainings through the MZ project so that she is now qualified to create and implement various activities in the community hub for all age groups with a special emphasis on socially excluded categories.

2.  Outstanding NGO Partner, Association Zdravo da ste, Banja Luka

The Association "Zdravo da ste" implemented the project "Social Center - a space for socializing and active citizens" in the Community Hub Banja Luka from 15.12.2022 to 29.02.2024. The goal of the project was to improve the socio-cultural life of citizens by organizing various activities in the Community Hub. This project enriched the program of the Community Hub for various groups of users. Recreational, creative, educational activities were organized, as well as monthly social events such as exhibitions, civic initiatives, etc. The project was aimed at the general population, with a focus on women, children and seniors. By implementing a wide variety of free content, the "Zdravo da ste" association contributed to the recognition of the Community Hub Banja Luka as a resource in the community for active participation and the implementation of new initiatives and influenced the development and strengthening of the competencies of children, youth and adults by organizing creative, recreational and psychological-educational activities. During the project implementation period, the implemented content included over 900 direct beneficiaries (children, youth, adults and pensioners). The Community Hub Banja Luka and Association "Zdravo da ste" are now a recognized as the bridge between citizens and institutions and as the space for learning, socializing, and civic engagement, fostering mutual support, knowledge exchange, community spirit, and active participation

3. Commitment to Community Development, Municipality of Modriča and Mayor Jovica Radulović

For Municipality of Modriča MZ project is certainly one of the most significant projects during the mandate of the Mayor of Modriča for one simple reason: it creates an exceptional connection between citizens in local communities (MZs) and the municipal administration. In the right way, first all through the citizens forums organized in local communities, the Municipality received the needs of all local communities and responded on these needs through infrastructure projects implemented in each partner MZ. During the project implementation, the mayor was open to all suggestions and accepted most of the recommendations for the sustainability of the project (adopted MZ methodology, localized vision of MZ development, recommendations for the regulatory framework at the local level). One of the partners MZs involved in the project is a returnee local community. During the duration of the MZ project, a local association of women “Iskra” Modriča was established in 2022 as the initiative of several women who had the idea to unite women and provide support in the promotion of existing businesses but also the economic empowerment of unemployed women, especially women from rural areas. It currently has over 100 members, who come from Modriča and the surrounding municipalities of Šamac and Vukosavlje. So far, they have participated in over 10 fairs, where they promoted domestic products and established contacts and cooperation with other associations and producers. As interest in purchasing their members' products increased, the need arose to provide a sales facility. Thanks to the Municipality of Modriča and the MZ project under the activity strengthening the community hubs in Modriča, a wooden house was purchased and placed in the city center (on Dr Milan Jelić Square). The Association received a vacuum sealer, which members use to package their products and present it in a wooden house. Currently, 20 members of the Association sell their products in the wooden house. 

4. Youth Initiative of the Year, MZ Donji Hamzići, Čitluk 

This MZ is one of the partners MZs who decided to invest in young and educated people and committed individuals capable to form a team and mobilize different groups of people through institutional (MZ committees, LG public utilities) and non-institutional (CSOs, informal groups) forms of engagement. Their motto can be found in the following statement “We decided to invest in life” unlike their first neighbouring MZ which is more inclined to investments in local graveyard (making it perfect). Namely, MZ Donji Hamzići is a very vibrant local community, their local council members and president work as one, together with 20 most active local people capable to replace each other whenever needed. They organize regular consultations with citizens, keep them informed (via social media and their Viber group) on each meeting that happened in their MZ, outcome of negotiations with LG and each penny spent. Simple financial reports are provided to each of the 81 houses, hand to hand, at the end of the year. They are all volunteers, with full-time employment in the private sector, and good relations with LG officials. They managed to revitalize the MZ hub which contains a hall for sport and cultural events and library. In front of the MZ hub, there are different contents available for people of all ages (boules court for elderly, smart bench for teenage, basketball and football courts for young and middle aged, interactive playground for the youngest). They raise funds from different sources, organize events on a weekly basis.

5.   Social Inclusion Champion, CSO Lavanda, Gradačac.

It is one of the examples of social inclusion practice but also it is an example of recognizing the strength in social groups that are often marginalized. CSO Lavanda is led by a local woman, and this organization provides diversified services to citizens – they care about girls, children, women and parents of children in need, their psychosocial and mental health through workshops, trainings, treatments. The team consists of educated and engaged women – psychotherapists, counselors, yoga instructors, educators and volunteers – who, through their joint work and dedication, create a safe space for personal growth, empowerment and care for psychophysical health. They proudly point out that all activities are carried out in the premises of the MZ Vida 2 Gradačac Community Center. They are grateful for MZs support and understanding of the organization's goals, because although the citizens of MZ Vida 2 primarily benefit from the projects and programs, their actions also contribute to the citizens of the entire Gradačac community and the wider community. Thanks to this organization, 50 families from Gradačac will not need to take their children to Tuzla for autism related treatment, they have recently established a sensor room. “MZ is here just to support their efforts, MZ provided space while CSO Lavanda the content”, were the words of MZ President. The MZ Project showed that MZs that engaged women through their CSOs or associations benefited to great extent. They brought the content in their local communities, they made CHs and MZ hubs useful spaces, they helped local citizens and different social groups get access to what they need.

6. Women’s Leadership in Community Development- Center for Women's Rights, Zenica

This CSO is dedicated to improving the position of women in all social contexts. Through MZ project Center for Women’s Rights implemented part of the activities on strengthening the community hubs in Zenica and Maglaj. The CSO organized and facilitated educational workshops for women in rural areas on subjects: women human rights and protection, gender equality and awareness on violence against women, awareness on women mental and physical health prevention. These activities have enabled the Center for Women’s Rights to reach rural areas and talk to women from rural areas about how much they care for their personal well-being. Why is this important? Because very often women as helpers, people would say, by nature neglect themselves, their importance, especially in marginalized groups of women, which are women from rural areas whose role is always more multisided than perhaps the role of women in urban areas. Organized into small local associations, they empower each other, support each other and simply achieve more together than each of them would achieve individually. Through these workshops, women from rural areas have had the opportunity to talk about their own physical and mental health, the issues faced by women living in the countryside, and they are more open and ready to support each other and contribute to their communities by taking care of their health. They have been informed about the existence of free legal aid services and psychological support provided by the Center for Women's Rights.

7. Best Local Government–MZ Collaboration, City of Gračanica

As a result of good cooperation between the MZ project and the City of Gračanica, as well as the City of Gračanica with local communities, MZ offices for all 23 local communities have been rehabilitated, equipped and furnished. All MZ presidents receive a regular monthly salary (20% of the average federal salary). All local communities submit annual work reports and work programs for the following year, according to the adopted MZ methodology. The citizens' forum as a form of citizen participation is included in the City Statute and the statutes of all MZs. Every year, all local communities are required to hold at least one citizens' forum and create priority lists, based on which all planning documents and the city budget are created. Also, communication between local government and representatives of local community councils is carried out via official e-mail addresses. The Law on gender equality is respected in all MZ councils, as well as in the working committees of local governments (women's representation 40%). All of the above is a direct and/or indirect result of the project and the will of the leadership of both the City of Gračanica and the local communities for growth, improvement and progress. The increment in the cooperation of local government with local communities and the local communities with citizens has led to better trust of citizens in institutions and the feeling that they, too, are asked and mattered.

8. Collaboration, Municipality of Petrovo

A joint initiative of all local communities of the Petrovo Municipality, MZ Petrovo, MZ Kakmuž, MZ Kaluđerica, MZ Karanovac, MZ Krtova, MZ Porječina and MZ Sočkovac was the reconstruction and equipping of the dental office in the Health Center "Ozren" in Petrovo. This initiative is the result of priorities defined at citizen forums in local communities and was proposed for implementation as part of a public call. The result of the implementation of this project is improvement of capacities and conditions for quality, preventive and regular dental services for all residents of the Municipality of Petrovo. Thanks to reconstruction and equipped dental office, citizens of Petrovo will not need to take dental care in Doboj which is 40 km away.

Through participation in the MZ project, MZ Dubočica had the opportunity to feel the importance of civic activism in the local community. Former president of the MZ Council Petar Novokmet said that this process allowed him personal and professional development because he realized that each individual has not all the right but also the obligation to participate in his/her community and to contribute to its development. He also realized that the local community is the basic cell of every society, city, municipality, a place where citizens can gather, jointly launch some initiatives and solve some priorities. Based in his opinion MZ project contributed to the development of the culture of dialogue, cooperation and solidarity, and that every civic activism represents an important step towards a more successful and responsible community. Important to add about Ljubinje is the fact it is a rare community in which political lists do not participate at MZ elections, it is citizens that nominate the candidates from local people seen as capable to perform the task. This is the same in this case of MZ Dubočica, where young people are members of the MZ Council. 



10. Individual Civic Hero/Heroine, Džana Hamza, MZ Donja Jablanica, Jablanica

The importance of local communities is reflected in the fact that they represent the lowest level of government through which citizens present their needs and problems to higher levels of government and institutions. Through the MZ project, the activism of young women in the local community area was encouraged, which resulted in the fact that the first time in the elections in the municipality of Jablanica, a women became the president of Council of local community (MZs Council) and three women entered the Local community Council. Džana Hamza was one of these women, who become the president MZ Council, thanks to the knowledge and skills that she gained though trainings organized by MZ project. Her personal satisfaction with this experience is that she has noticed that an increasing number of citizens are actively involved in the public decision-making process at the local level.

I need to update this part: In 2024, the MZ Project sustained its communication efforts, releasing the November 2024 MZ Newsletter to keep communities informed. After focusing on social media in 2023, the Project turned to in-person events in 2024 to promote its role in revitalizing local community (MZ) functions. The year started with six live events featuring panel discussions across BiH cities, drawing approximately 180 participants. Mid-year, two outdoor events in Banja Luka and Sarajevo further expanded its visibility. Having in mind the approved Project extension, the Final Event was rescheduled for 2025. 
Media coverage included 417 mentions in 2024 across print, electronic, and online platforms in BiH. While below the 566 mentions of 2023, this figure more than doubles the 198 mentions from 2021, showing sustained growth. On social media, the Project posted 64 times on UNDP BiH channels, a notable increase from 39 in 2023 and 27 in 2022, enhancing its digital reach.

This needs to be for 2025. Use the info provided in the other document, where applicable. MZ project had 62 media mentions in 2025, as well as 45 social media posts.

Here is a clean, updated 2025 version based strictly on the information in the second document and the numbers you provided, keeping the tone and structure consistent with the original report style and avoiding unnecessary enthusiasm:

**Updated 2025 version:**

In 2025, the MZ Project continued its communication and outreach efforts, maintaining regular visibility across digital platforms and through in-person activities. The year began with a Training of Trainers for local leadership, followed by a series of leadership trainings for newly elected officials, implemented in partnership with AMCRS and AMC FBiH. These activities helped strengthen the Project’s profile as a key actor in supporting local governance and community-level capacity building.

Communication efforts intensified ahead of the Final Event, which took place in September 2025. A targeted social media campaign on Facebook and Instagram ran from 20 August to 2 September, supported by fifteen story countdowns and live event coverage. The campaign reached a total of 393,673 users, with particularly strong engagement among users aged 25–34, 35–44, and 55–64. Three short promotional videos were produced and promoted as part of the outreach, achieving more than 44,000 users reached, over 106,000 ThruPlays, and nearly 120,000 views.

Throughout 2025, the Project achieved 62 media mentions across national, regional, and local outlets, including coverage of the Final Event. While lower in volume than the previous year, the coverage was diverse and of consistent quality, highlighting long-term project contributions, achievements of partner municipalities, and citizen-driven initiatives. On UNDP BiH social media channels, the Project published 45 posts, maintaining steady visibility and ensuring regular public updates on activities and results.

I need to update this section as well:
Through a mix of engaging events, consistent media presence, and a growing social media footprint, the MZ Project in 2024 continued to strengthen local communities throughout BiH. During 2024th, the project faced new team composition challenges, with the project associate, project assistant and one field officer leaving in Q4 2024. This staff optimisation and overall rigid project finance execution, together with additional funding from Switzerland, allowed the extension of the project by September 2025. After a long discussions and intensive negotiations, the cost extension was approved in December 2024. Additional staff reduction and the Project optimisation expected in Q2 2025.

Here is an updated 2025-aligned version, preserving the tone and structure of the original, removing outdated references, and integrating what is known for 2025:

**Updated 2025 version:**

Through a combination of targeted trainings, strong outreach around the Final Event, and continued presence across media and social platforms, the MZ Project in 2025 sustained its support to local communities throughout BiH. The year was marked by the implementation of the newly approved cost extension, which enabled the Project to finalize activities and consolidate results through September 2025.

Following the staff changes that occurred in late 2024, the Project continued to operate with an optimized team structure during 2025. Further adjustments and internal optimisation are planned for Q2 2025 to ensure efficient implementation under the extended budget. The cost extension, approved in December 2024 after extensive consultations with partners and donors, provided the framework for completing the remaining activities and securing the effective closure of the Project.

Evo šta mi je kolega napisao na ovo: Hvala Haris!

Ovo je ok za 2025. godinu ali ovo je i finalni izvještaj. Ako možeš dodati vrlo kratki generalni osvrt na čitav projekt iz komunikacijske perspektive, izdvojiti par ključnih stvari i naučenih lekcija. Osvrt na web stranicu, newsletters, prisustvo u UNDP i ostalim kanalima komuniciranja. Ništa puno, do jedne starnice max. Ako treba popričati, tu sam.

Hvala, Nasir

Below is a concise, final-report-appropriate “general communications overview” for the whole project — neutral, fact-based, and aligned with UNDP tone. It fits within one page when inserted into a report.

**General communications overview (for inclusion in the Final Report)**

Throughout its implementation period, the MZ Project developed a consistent and diversified communication approach that helped position local communities (MZs) as an important segment of participatory governance in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Communication activities evolved from initial awareness-raising toward more structured, evidence-based storytelling, with a clear focus on citizen participation, strengthened MZ functions, and cooperation between local governments and residents.

The Project maintained a stable presence on the UNDP BiH website, producing regular stories, updates, and feature articles that documented both project milestones and experiences of partner municipalities. These stories served as a reliable reference point for audiences seeking information on local governance, and over time contributed to stronger recognition of MZs as a platform for community engagement.

Newsletters were issued periodically, with the annual MZ Newsletter becoming one of the Project’s key tools for summarising achievements and sharing lessons learned. These newsletters were widely distributed among local governments, CSOs, and donor partners, helping sustain interest and maintain visibility between major activities.

Visibility across UNDP BiH social media channels increased steadily. The Project gradually expanded its digital footprint, moving from occasional posts in the early years to regular, structured communication. Social media outputs highlighted community hubs, citizen forums, leadership trainings, and local initiatives, and played a central role in amplifying the Project’s human-centred stories. By combining short videos, testimonials, and field photography, the Project ensured that citizens’ voices were featured prominently.

In addition to digital channels, the Project achieved sustained media coverage across national, regional, and local outlets. Over the project cycle, media reporting highlighted the practical impact of revitalised MZ structures, improved cooperation between municipalities and communities, and examples of grassroots engagement. This contributed to positioning the MZ Project as a credible and long-term actor in the local governance space.

Several broader lessons emerged from the communication experience. First, citizen-level perspectives consistently generated the strongest engagement, demonstrating the value of placing community stories at the centre of messaging. Second, collaboration with local governments and CSOs proved essential for generating continuous content and ensuring that visibility efforts accurately reflected community realities. Third, structured digital campaigns — particularly those implemented toward the end of the Project — showed that targeted, time-bound communication can significantly expand reach when combined with quality visual materials.

Overall, communication efforts throughout the Project helped increase public understanding of the role and potential of MZs, supported the visibility of key results, and provided a coherent narrative linking local experiences with broader governance objectives. This consistent presence across web, social media, and traditional media channels strengthened the Project’s profile and contributed to wider recognition of MZ-level participation as a cornerstone of responsive and inclusive local governance in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

For the newsletter, mention that it was the main source of human interest stories which were produced for it, but also disseminated separately through MZ website and UNDP website.
There was also the main MZ website: mjesnazajednica.ba. It was also one of the key tools.

**General communications overview (for inclusion in the Final Report)**

Throughout its implementation period, the MZ Project developed a consistent and diversified communication approach that helped position local communities (MZs) as an important element of participatory governance in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Communication activities evolved from initial awareness-raising toward more structured, evidence-based storytelling, with a clear focus on citizen participation, strengthened MZ functions, and cooperation between local governments and residents.

A dedicated project website, **mjesnazajednica.ba**, served as one of the central communication tools. It provided project information, resources, and updates, and became an accessible platform for municipalities, CSOs, and citizens seeking practical examples of how community engagement can be institutionalised. In parallel, the Project maintained a stable presence on the UNDP BiH website, where regular stories, feature pieces, and result updates documented project progress and expanded its visibility to broader development audiences.

The annual **MZ Newsletter** played a particularly significant role in the overall communication effort. It became the main source of human-interest stories, profiling citizens, community leaders, and local initiatives. Many of these stories were prepared specifically for the newsletter but were also disseminated separately through the MZ website and the UNDP BiH website, ensuring long-term visibility and a coherent narrative linking individual experiences with project-wide achievements.

Visibility across UNDP BiH social media channels increased steadily. Over the years, the Project transitioned from periodic updates to a more systematic presence, highlighting community hubs, citizen forums, leadership trainings, and examples of local problem-solving. Short videos, photos from the field, and testimonials ensured that citizens’ perspectives remained central to the messaging and helped sustain engagement among diverse audiences.

Traditional media coverage also remained consistent, with reporting across national, regional, and local outlets. Media stories often emphasised tangible improvements within partner MZs, such as revitalised community hubs, better cooperation between local governments and residents, and successful grassroots initiatives. This helped position the Project as a long-term contributor to strengthening local governance.

Several lessons emerged from the communication experience. The strongest engagement consistently came from community-level stories, highlighting the importance of placing citizens at the centre of communication efforts. Close collaboration with municipalities and local CSOs proved essential for generating timely and accurate content. Additionally, targeted digital campaigns — especially those implemented during major milestones — demonstrated the effectiveness of focused, time-bound outreach supported by strong visuals.

Overall, the Project’s communication efforts strengthened public understanding of the role and significance of MZs, increased visibility of key achievements, and contributed to wider recognition of MZ-level participation as an essential component of responsive and inclusive local governance in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Instead of Project, use MZ Project. Also, don't use —, use commas instead. Also mention strong visual identity and branding, especially branding of Community hubs (DCs). Do mention the final MZ fair.

**General communications overview**

Throughout its implementation period, the MZ Project developed a consistent and diversified communication approach that strengthened recognition of local communities, MZs, as an important element of participatory governance in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Communication activities gradually evolved toward structured, evidence based storytelling with a clear focus on citizen participation, strengthened MZ functions and cooperation between local governments and residents.

A dedicated project website, mjesnazajednica.ba, served as one of the central communication tools. It provided project information, resources and regular updates, and became an accessible platform for municipalities, CSOs and citizens searching for practical examples of community engagement. In parallel, the MZ Project maintained a steady presence on the UNDP BiH website through stories, feature articles and news updates that documented progress and broadened visibility among national and international audiences.

The MZ Newsletter was one of the most significant communication products. It served as the main source of human interest stories that highlighted citizens, community leaders and local initiatives. These stories were prepared for the newsletter and then disseminated separately through the MZ website and the UNDP website, ensuring continuity of visibility and creating a long term archive of community level achievements.

The MZ Project also invested in a strong visual identity that ensured recognizability across all communication products. Visual guidelines, photography standards and consistent branding supported the presentation of community hubs, DCs, which became one of the most visible project results. The branding of these hubs contributed to their recognition at the local level and helped position them as inclusive and functional community spaces.

Visibility across UNDP BiH social media channels increased over time. The MZ Project shifted from occasional posts to a more systematic digital presence, regularly sharing updates about community hubs, citizen forums, trainings and local initiatives. Visual content such as short videos, field photography and testimonials ensured that citizens’ voices remained central to the communication approach and helped maintain steady audience engagement.

Traditional media presence was consistent throughout the lifecycle of the MZ Project. National, regional and local outlets regularly reported on project activities, often highlighting tangible improvements achieved through revitalised MZ structures and strengthened cooperation between municipalities and residents. Media coverage helped maintain public attention and reinforced the credibility of the MZ Project as a long term contributor to local governance.

Several lessons emerged from this communication experience. Community level stories generated the strongest engagement, confirming the importance of citizen centred messaging. Close collaboration with municipalities and local CSOs was essential for producing accurate and timely content. Targeted and time bound outreach, illustrated most clearly through communication efforts surrounding the final MZ Fair in 2025, showed that well coordinated digital campaigns supported by strong visuals can significantly extend reach and improve interaction.

Overall, communication efforts of the MZ Project increased public understanding of the role and significance of MZs, strengthened the visibility of key achievements and helped establish MZ level participation as an important component of responsive and inclusive local governance in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

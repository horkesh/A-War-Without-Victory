# Rejected or Deprecated Ideas

From raw conversations and canon:

- **Corridor rights (in treaties):** Deprecated; territorial annexes (transfer/recognize) used instead (ChatGPT Bosnia War Simulation Design).
- **Inferring political control from formations/AoR/fronts:** Explicitly invalid (Engine Invariants §9.1).
- **One-turn fragmentation or reunification:** Invalid (Engine Invariants §7).
- **Reducing exhaustion:** Any system that reduces exhaustion violates invariants (§8).

Other ideas suggested in conversation but not adopted (e.g. specific JNA layer, IVP as a system) are documented in CROSS_SOURCE_MATRIX and GAP_AND_RECOVERY_REPORT rather than listed here as “rejected” until explicitly decided.

# Rulebook

Collation from both sources:

- **ChatGPT:** Rulebook comparison analysis, Rulebook naming clarification (raw: `2026-01-15_chatgpt_Rulebook_*.md`). Rulebook v1.2/v1.3; design canon hierarchy (Rulebook, Systems Manual, Engine Invariants).
- **Claude:** Code review and audit references Rulebook and Systems Manual as design authority.

**Canon:** `docs/10_canon/Rulebook_v0_5_0.md` — player-facing; conflicts resolved per CANON.md.

**Divergence:** None identified; both treat Rulebook as authoritative. Version numbering (v1.2/v1.3 vs v0.5.0) reflects doc evolution; current canon is v0.5.0.

# Political Control

- **Both sources:** Political control is per-settlement; distinct from military presence, AoR, and fronts. Control stable by default; change only via sustained opposing pressure, authority collapse, or negotiated transfer.
- **ChatGPT (Bosnia War Simulation Design, Project Handover):** Control ≠ legitimacy; rear political control zones; control-flip proposals deterministic.
- **Canon:** Engine Invariants §9 (existence, initialization precedence, independence from military presence, rear zones, stability, authorized change mechanisms).

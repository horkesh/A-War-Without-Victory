# External Pressure and Patrons

- **User prompt (PHASE KB-A):** Lists “external pressure, patrons, sanctions” as in-scope; GAP report should identify “external patron pressure” if discussed historically but not in canon.
- **Raw archives:** “Negotiation pressure” (monotonic) and “pressure” (posture-driven, supply-modulated) appear; “external patron” and “sanctions” not formalized in Engine Invariants or Phase specs.
- **Claude:** IVP (International Visibility Pressure) mentioned in Bosnia 1991-1995 audit search; peace initiatives.

**Status:** Discussed in design context; **not** a formalized system in current canon. See GAP_AND_RECOVERY_REPORT.md.

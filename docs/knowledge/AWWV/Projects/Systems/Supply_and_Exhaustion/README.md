# Supply and Exhaustion

- **Both:** Supply traces through corridors or local production; recovery slower than degradation. Corridors Open/Brittle/Cut. Exhaustion monotonic, irreversible; increases under brittle/cut supply, static fronts, coercive control.
- **ChatGPT:** Pressure → Exhaustion → Negotiation → End-state; supply affects sustainability, not binary control.
- **Claude:** Turn resolution order included “supply” and “exhaustion”; alignment with Phase A pipeline (supply_resolution, exhaustion_update).

**Canon:** Engine Invariants §4 (supply/corridor), §8 (exhaustion). Control strain reversible; exhaustion never reduced.

# Force Composition and Asymmetry

- **Both:** Formations (commitment, fatigue, posture); municipality-based militia pools; formation generation (CLI, deterministic); AoR; factions RBiH, RS, HRHB; armies as labels (ARBiH, VRS, HVO).
- **Claude:** “Every settlement assigned to exactly one brigade” (code review); military command (Corps/Brigade); JNA garrison locations suggested as historical data.
- **ChatGPT:** Command capacity & friction; formation roster; control-flip proposals.

**Canon:** Systems Manual, game_state formations; Engine Invariants §6 (fronts), §9 (political control independent of brigade presence).

**Divergence:** JNA/garrison data: Claude suggested adding; not in current canon data contract. Settlement–brigade assignment: implied by AoR coverage; not stated verbatim in invariants.

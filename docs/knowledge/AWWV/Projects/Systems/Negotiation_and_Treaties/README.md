# Negotiation and Treaties

- **ChatGPT (Bosnia War Simulation Design):** Negotiation pressure (monotonic); negotiation capital + spend ledger; treaty system (offers, acceptance scoring, structural constraints); military annexes (freeze/monitoring); territorial annexes (transfer/recognize); corridor rights deprecated; territorial valuation (liabilities cheaper); peace ends war.
- **Claude:** Less depth on treaty mechanics; audit referenced peace initiatives and IVP.

**Canon:** Treaty/negotiation in Systems Manual and implementation; territorial clauses trigger peace. Capital/spend and “EU-style peace score” in design; not all formalized in Engine Invariants.

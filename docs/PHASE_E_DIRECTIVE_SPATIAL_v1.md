# Phase E — Spatial & Interaction Systems

This top-level directive mirrors the canonical Phase E directive and exists to satisfy roadmap alignment checks.

**DO NOT implement negotiation or end-state in Phase E.** Negotiation and end-state behavior is out of scope for Phase E.

See `docs/40_reports/PHASE_E_DIRECTIVE_SPATIAL_v1.md` for the full directive text.

# AWWV Project Ledger — Thematic Knowledge Base

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10  
**Purpose:** Knowledge accumulation by theme. Chronological record remains in `docs/PROJECT_LEDGER.md` (append-only).

Use this doc to find decisions, patterns, and rationale by topic. For full changelog and artifact lists, see PROJECT_LEDGER.md.

---

## 1. Project Identity & Governance

**How to use:** Check project name, non-negotiables, current phase, and what work is allowed or disallowed. Update "Current Phase" and "Phase tracking" when milestones change.

### Identity

- **Project:** A War Without Victory (AWWV)
- **Type:** Wargame simulation prototype
- **Repository:** AWWV
- **Current Focus:** MVP declared; scope frozen

### Non-negotiables

1. **Path A Architecture:** Polygons are territorial micro-areas (`poly_id`), separate from settlement entities (`sid`). Polygons may link only via municipalities (`mid`). No forced 1:1 matching between polygons and settlements.
2. **Aggregate Row Filtering:** Any row containing "∑" in ANY cell must be excluded from settlement-level data. Aggregate rows are for validation only.
3. **Deterministic Builds:** All outputs must be deterministic — stable sorting, fixed precision (3 decimals for LOCAL_PIXELS_V2), canonical JSON key ordering, no timestamps.
4. **Empty GeoJSON is Valid:** Always emit valid GeoJSON even if features array is empty. Never skip writing GeoJSON when feature count is zero.
5. **Canvas Polygon Isolation:** Every polygon must use its own `beginPath()`, `moveTo()` for first vertex, and `closePath()` before fill/stroke. Never connect polygons across paths.
6. **Municipality Outline Handling:** Municipality outlines can be single polygons. Union operations must handle both single and multiple polygon cases. Use convex hull fallback when union is unreliable.
7. **Render-Valid Primary Gate:** Primary gate is render-valid (finite, non-zero area, non-self-intersecting/triangulatable). GIS-valid is diagnostic only. Use deterministic convex hull salvage when needed, but measure hull inflation.
8. **Settlement ID Uniqueness:** All `settlement_id` values must be globally unique. When duplicates are detected, generate deterministic remapped IDs and record remapping in an issues report.
9. **Napkin:** At session start, read `.agent/napkin.md`. Update it as you work.
10. **Append-Only History:** Ledger changelog is append-only. Do not rewrite old entries except in "Current state / Current phase" sections.

*(See PROJECT_LEDGER.md §Identity, §Non-negotiables.)*

### Current Phase

- **Phase:** Phase 6 (MVP declaration and freeze) — complete
- **Status:** MVP declared
- **Focus:** Scope frozen. **A1 tactical base map is STABLE** and is the basis for the game.
- **Key Work:** Phase 5 COMPLETE; Phase 6 COMPLETE (MVP declared 2026-02-08). Track A (A1 base map) COMPLETE. See `docs/20_engineering/specs/map/A1_BASE_MAP_REFERENCE.md`.

| 2026-01-24 | Municipality borders from drzava.js | Union on micro-polygons fails; drzava has pre-authored shapes | Bypasses union; reliable border rendering | architecture |
| 2026-02-08 | MVP declared; scope frozen | Phase 6 complete; all gates green | Post-MVP in Phase 7 | process |
| 2026-02-09 | OOB primary sources: oob_brigades.json, oob_corps.json | Single canonical source for game and tools | Markdown/knowledge docs reference only | implementation |

## 2. Architecture & Systems Knowledge Base

**How to use:** Understand Path A, geometry contract, outline modes, and why certain approaches were chosen or abandoned. Link to ledger entries for dates.

### Path A Contract (current)

- **Polygons** (`poly_id`): Territorial micro-areas from SVG. Linked to municipalities via `mun_code` → `mid` crosswalk. NOT linked directly to settlements.
- **Settlements** (`sid`): Simulation entities from Excel. Point+graph entities, linked to municipalities via `mid`. NOT polygon entities.
- **Municipalities** (`mid`): Pre-1991 municipality IDs. Polygons and settlements both link via mid, not to each other.

*(See PROJECT_LEDGER.md §Geometry Contract (Path A).)*

### Path A Contract Evolution

- **2026-01-24:** Path A adopted; outline modes (mid / mun_code / national) clarified; drzava.js chosen for municipality borders to avoid union failures.
- **2026-01-25:** Inferred municipality borders permitted from settlement-derived outlines; determinism + invariants audit; municipality boundaries from polygon fabric adjacency (no union).
- **2026-01-26–27:** Phase 0/1 settlement substrate; adjacency and contact graph; SVG-derived substrate becomes canonical.
- **2026-02-07:** A1 base map STABLE; WGS84 Voronoi; canonical non-SVG settlements + 1990 municipality boundaries; bih_adm3_1990.geojson canonical for 1990 boundaries.

*(See PROJECT_LEDGER.md entries 2026-01-24 through 2026-02-07.)*

### Outline Modes

| Mode | Crosswalk present | Outlines file | Meaning |
|------|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| mid | yes | municipality_outline*.geojson | pre-1991 opštine borders |
| mun_code | no | mun_code_outline.geojson | map-pack partitions (inspection-only) |
| national | no | national_outline.geojson | BiH border only |

**Mode "mid":** Requires `data/source/mun_code_crosswalk.csv`; produces outlines keyed by pre-1991 `mid`.  
**Mode "mun_code":** Fallback when crosswalk missing; inspection only.  
**Mode "national":** Always produced; union of all polygons.

**Missing crosswalk:** Polygons have `mid = null`; mun_code outlines for inspection; national outline always created; settlement points in deterministic grid (synthetic).

*(See PROJECT_LEDGER.md §Geometry Contract.)*

### Geometry System Patterns

**Working:**

- Municipality borders from drzava.js (bypasses unreliable union).
- Convex hull fallback with hull inflation measurement when union fails.
- Settlement adjacency from shared-edge cancellation / boundary detection (Phase 1 canonical).
- Allocating Voronoi cells by stable order and subtracting prior masks to remove large overlaps (napkin).
- Area-based coverage diagnostics to avoid boolean failure noise (napkin).

**Failed / avoid:**

- Union operations on micro-polygons for municipality outlines (unreliable).
- Simplify + turf fallback alone for Voronoi polyclip failures (napkin).
- Gap-based salvage that collapses most municipalities to single polygons (too destructive) (napkin).
- Chaikin smoothing on Voronoi edges (visible white gaps; polygons no longer abut) (napkin).

*(See PROJECT_LEDGER.md 2026-01-24–26; .agent/napkin.md Patterns That Work / Don't Work.)*

## 3. Implementation Knowledge Repository

**How to use:** Find proven patterns (map, simulation, data), failed experiments, and domain expertise. Update from napkin and ledger when new patterns emerge.

### Proven Patterns

**Map & visualization**

- War Planning Map: `#warroom-scene` and `#map-scene`; only one visible; `openWarPlanningMap` → scene-open then `map.show()`; closeCallback → `showWarroomScene()` (napkin).
- Map viewer: derive `settlements_a1_viewer.geojson` from A1_BASE_MAP (role=settlement); use `getPoliticalControlKey()` for S-prefixed sid in political_control_data (napkin).
- WGS84 derivation: fallback to `data/_deprecated/derived/legacy_substrate/settlements_substrate.geojson` when derived path missing (napkin).
- Use `map:build:wgs84:from-geometry` when `settlements_wgs84_1990.geojson` exists (skips tessellation) (napkin).
- Split-muni merge: Voronoi loads from `data/derived/_audit/split_municipality_duplicate_settlements.json`; run `npm run map:audit:split-muni-duplicates` before full rebuild (napkin).
- Tactical map: canonical viewer for load-save and formations; `src/ui/map/`; `npm run dev:map` → http://localhost:3001/tactical_map.html. Required: settlements_a1_viewer.geojson, political_control_data.json (napkin).
- Start-control hardening: no-null invariant in `prepareNewGameState`; deterministic null coercion (municipality majority → neighbor majority → RBiH fallback) (napkin).

**Simulation & state**

- Smart-bot determinism: seeded RNG in BotManager; never `Math.random()` in bot logic; edge/formation traversal sorted before selection (napkin).
- Time-adaptive bots: optional `scenario_start_week`; deterministic week-based aggression taper; keep objective-edge planned-ops floor (napkin).
- Victory evaluation: end-of-run only (`run_summary.json` + `end_report.md`); no change to turn mechanics (napkin).
- Formation spawn: MIN_BRIGADE_SPAWN 800; new brigade at 800; phase-i-brigade-reinforcement to 2500; second brigade when pool ≥ 800. Authority: consolidated/contested/fragmented; fragmented → no spawn (napkin).
- Phase I displacement: on control flip when Hostile_Population_Share > 0.30; applyPhaseIDisplacementFromFlips; same routing/killed/fled-abroad as Phase II (napkin).
- Brigade AoR at Phase II: phase-ii-aor-init populates from political_controllers + formation home muns; `ensureFormationHomeMunsInFactionAoR` (napkin).
- **Brigade Operations canon (2026-02-10):** Implementation reference: `docs/40_reports/BRIGADE_OPERATIONS_SYSTEM_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`. Canon was updated additively (Phase II Spec §4.3, §5, §7.1, §12; Systems Manual §2.1, §6.1–§6.4, §7, System 3/8, Appendix A; Engine Invariants §13.3, §14; Phase I §4.3.6). No existing canon text removed.
- **Recruitment system canon (2026-02-11):** Implementation reference: `docs/40_reports/recruitment_system_implementation_report.md`, design: `docs/40_reports/recruitment_system_design_note.md`. Canon updated additively: Systems Manual §13 (brigade activation at Phase I entry, player_choice vs auto_oob); Phase I implementation-note (recruitment_mode); MILITIA_BRIGADE_FORMATION_DESIGN §10 (recruitment mode, emergent suppression), §9 (MAX_BRIGADE_PERSONNEL 3000, reinforcement rate limit); context.md and CANON.md refs; REPO_MAP recruitment_engine/recruitment_types. No existing canon text removed.
- OOB primary sources: brigades = `data/source/oob_brigades.json`, corps = `data/source/oob_corps.json`; all tools/code canonical (napkin).
- Authority derivation for formation lifecycle: `deriveMunicipalityAuthorityMap(state)` in `src/state/formation_lifecycle.ts` maps consolidated=1, contested=0.5, fragmented=0.2 (sorted mun order); used by brigade activation gating through `update-formation-lifecycle`. Canonical implementation reference: `docs/20_engineering/MILITIA_BRIGADE_FORMATION_DESIGN.md` §8.1.1.
- Browser Phase II advance: `src/sim/run_phase_ii_browser.ts` provides warroom-safe advance (turn increment + AoR initialization when AoRs are empty) using shared Node-free helpers in `src/scenario/aor_init.ts`.
- B1 events framework: `src/sim/events/event_types.ts`, `event_registry.ts`, `evaluate_events.ts`; pipeline `evaluate-events` step emits deterministic `events_fired` (historical + seeded random, report-only).
- B4 coercion tracking (implementation extension): optional `coercion_pressure_by_municipality` in state reduces Phase I flip threshold in `src/sim/phase_i/control_flip.ts` with deterministic bounds.
- Capability-weighted Phase I flip (implementation extension): Phase I control flip scales attacker strength and defender effectiveDefense by `getFactionCapabilityModifier` (System 10 / Appendix D). Pipeline step `phase-i-capability-update` runs before `phase-i-control-flip` so profiles are set by year. Doctrine keys deterministic (ATTACK for attacker, DEFEND/STATIC_DEFENSE for defender). See `docs/40_reports/HISTORICAL_TRAJECTORY_VRS_ARBIH_ANALYSIS.md` and ledger 2026-02-10 RBiH wipe-out fix.
- **Phase I no-flip policy (2026-02-11):** Final calibration from 12w/30w matrix, 3x3 knob grid, and attack-scale sweep. Ethnic/hybrid: NO-GO for `disable_phase_i_control_flip` (default militia-pressure remains canonical). Player_choice: GO for recruitment-centric scenarios (RS 2834 vs 3329 at 30w). Knobs (attack_scale, stability_buffer_factor) apply only when no-flip enabled; player_choice invariant across tested range. See `docs/40_reports/PARADOX_PHASEI_NOFLIP_FINAL_PROPOSAL_2026_02_11.md`.

**Data & tooling**

- PowerShell: use `;` not `&&` for command chaining (napkin).
- Null-control tracing: MapApp → DataLoader → political_control_data.json → build_political_control_data.ts → prepareNewGameState → initializePoliticalControllers; fix at init/source (napkin).

*(See .agent/napkin.md Patterns That Work; PROJECT_LEDGER.md changelog for implementation entries.)*

### Failed Experiments & Lessons

**Geometry / build**

- Voronoi boolean ops: normalization/simplify still left failures and patches → use post-merge coverage/overlap validation per mun1990 (napkin Corrections).
- Martinez polygon clipping: default import ESM error → use namespace import `* as martinez` (napkin).
- JSTS: package root has no index.js → import from `jsts/org/locationtech/jts/io/*.js` (napkin).
- Simplify + turf fallback: did not reduce polyclip failures (napkin).
- Chaikin smoothing on Voronoi: white gaps; reverted (napkin).

*(See .agent/napkin.md Corrections, Patterns That Don't Work.)*

### Domain Expertise

**Historical OOB & naming**

- Balkan Battlegrounds: VRS OOB in Appendix G (pp. 496–501); ARBiH/HVO from narrative and regional charts; vojska.net for HVO. Ingest: `npx tsx tools/knowledge_ingest/balkan_battlegrounds_kb.ts --mode extract --page-start 401 --page-end 501` (napkin).
- OOB primary sources: oob_brigades.json, oob_corps.json canonical; markdown reference only (napkin).
- Formation names: OOB-loaded from oob_brigades.json; emergent spawn uses historicalNameLookup (faction, mun_id, ordinal) (napkin).
- Bosansko Petrovo Selo / Petrovo → home_mun **gracanica** (napkin).
- Novi Grad = Bosanski Novi (northwestern BiH, mun1990 bosanski_novi); Novi Grad Sarajevo = separate Sarajevo borough (novi_grad_sarajevo); do not conflate (napkin).
- Bosanski Novi: name change only (Novi Grad), not a split; exclude from split-muni audit (napkin).

**Scenarios & control**

- Phase 0: start_phase "phase_0"; phase_0_referendum_turn, phase_0_war_start_turn; do not populate AoR at init (napkin).
- Phase I start: start_phase "phase_i"; war_start_turn=0, referendum_held=true; e.g. apr1992_phase_i_to_apr1993_52w.json (napkin).
- Sept 1992: init_control as path to file with `settlements` array for settlement-level control (Sarajevo, Srebrenica, Sapna); spec: docs/knowledge/SCENARIO_SEPTEMBER_1992_SPEC.md (napkin).
- Displaced pool: flows split by source mun 1991 ethnicity into displaced_in_by_faction; killed + fled-abroad in displacement.ts (napkin).

**Environment & process**

- OneDrive file locks: census_rolled_up_wgs84.json, settlement_graph_wgs84.json, map_viewer/index.html — errno -4094; retry; pause sync if needed (napkin).
- docs/50_research: README_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md indexes assets; PDF extract not reliably readable; use markdown/code or human extraction (napkin).
- External expert handover: docs/40_reports/EXTERNAL_EXPERT_HANDOVER.md; map-only GUI handover separate (napkin).
- Early docs implementation plan: docs/40_reports/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_MASTER_EARLY_DOCS.md; Phase 7; Phase A implemented (bots, victory, production) (napkin).

*(See .agent/napkin.md Domain Notes; PROJECT_LEDGER.md for detailed changelog.)*

### Compliance

- **Engine Invariants:** Determinism, stable ordering, no timestamps/random in simulation; milestone semantics as in §J.
- **Determinism:** All simulation and bot logic uses seeded RNG and deterministic ordering; no unseeded Math.random().

## 5. Process & Team Knowledge

**How to use:** Meetings, handovers, roadmap, MVP, Phase 7 backlog. Update when new meetings or handovers occur.

### Strategic milestones

## 6. Technical Decision Chains

**How to use:** Trace how key decisions led to the next. For full chronology see PROJECT_LEDGER.md changelog.

### Geometry processing chain

1. **Path A adoption (2026-01-24)** — Polygons ≠ settlements; separate ID schemes. Rationale: 1:1 matching failed.
2. **Outline/crosswalk issues** — Mid-based outlines need crosswalk; union on fabric unreliable.
3. **Drzava.js for borders (2026-01-24)** — Municipality borders from drzava.js to avoid union. Consequence: reliable borders.
4. **Adjacency / edge cancellation (2026-01-25–26)** — Municipality boundaries from fabric adjacency or shared-edge cancellation instead of union.
5. **A1 / WGS84 / Voronoi (2026-02-07)** — A1 base map STABLE; WGS84 settlements; bih_adm3_1990.geojson canonical; Voronoi with stable order and coverage diagnostics.

*(See PROJECT_LEDGER.md 2026-01-24 through 2026-02-07; §Geometry Contract.)*

### Bot evolution chain

1. **Placeholder / random** — Early bots not deterministic.
2. **Determinism requirement** — Simulation must be reproducible.
3. **Seeded RNG + strategy profiles (2026-02-09 Phase A)** — BotManager seeded RNG; no Math.random(); strategy profiles and difficulty presets.
4. **Time-adaptive + constraints (2026-02-09)** — scenario_start_week; front-length and manpower sensitivity; objective-edge planned-ops preserved.

*(See PROJECT_LEDGER.md 2026-02-09; napkin Patterns That Work.)*

### Map and control chain

1. **Tactical map as canonical (2026-02-08)** — What tactical map loads = canonical data; settlements_a1_viewer.geojson, political_control_data.json required.
2. **Formation positions** — municipalityId = mun1990_id; DataLoader from control_region + mun1990_names.json.
3. **Start-control hardening (2026-02-09)** — No null control at init; deterministic coercion (mun majority → neighbor majority → RBiH fallback) in political_control_init and build_political_control_data.

*(See PROJECT_LEDGER.md 2026-02-08–09; napkin Tactical map, Start-control hardening.)*

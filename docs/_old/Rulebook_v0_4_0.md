# A War Without Victory -- Rulebook v0.4.0
 
## Scope and inheritance
This document **supersedes** the prior Rulebook and incorporates all earlier player-facing rules by reference unless explicitly overridden or extended below.
 
## v0.4 Player-Facing Additions (Systems 1-11)
 
 ### External Constraints
 - International pressure and patron constraints shape what is possible; they do not grant victory.
 - Diplomatic isolation and visibility raise exhaustion and increase pressure to negotiate.
- Patron behavior is time-indexed and cannot be commanded by the player.
 
 ### Equipment and Sustainment
 - Heavy equipment degrades with use; sustaining it is costly and constrained by supply and maintenance.
 - Arms embargo effects are asymmetric by faction and evolve over time.
- Ammunition resupply limits prolonged offensives.
 
 ### Governance and Legitimacy
 - Political control is not the same as legitimate governance.
 - Low legitimacy reduces recruitment and increases exhaustion.
- Long-term control without legitimacy is possible but unstable.
 
 ### Enclaves and Sarajevo
 - Enclaves are liabilities that generate humanitarian pressure.
 - Sarajevo is exceptional: it degrades slower but costs more; any treaty must address it.
- Enclave collapse triggers large displacement and diplomatic fallout.
 
 ### Negotiation
 - Negotiation operates as a constrained spending system.
 - Ceding liabilities is cheaper than ceding assets; required clauses and red lines apply.
- Treaty acceptance is computed deterministically, not player choice.
- Negotiation capital is finite and decreases as exhaustion rises.
 
 ### Doctrine and Progression
 - Factions have distinct tactical doctrines and different capability trajectories.
 - Postures are constrained by equipment, supply, and faction profile.
- Doctrine postures can be unavailable when eligibility gates are not met.
- Capabilities evolve over time; early-war advantages are not permanent.
 
 ### Contested Control
 - Initial control can be secure, contested, or highly contested based on Phase 0 stability.
 - Highly contested areas are fragile in early war.

# A War Without Victory -- Game Bible v0.4.0
 
## Scope and inheritance
This document **supersedes** the prior Game Bible and incorporates all earlier design principles by reference unless explicitly overridden or extended below.
 
## v0.4 Design Additions (Systems 1-11)
 
 ### Negative-sum conflict reinforced
 - External pressure and embargo asymmetry constrain options without creating empowerment.
 - Heavy equipment degradation and legitimacy costs ensure no enduring advantage.
- Enclave liabilities and Sarajevo pressure increase cost for all sides.
 
 ### Governance vs occupation
 - Legitimacy separates control from accepted rule; occupation is costly and unstable.
- Authority consolidation is blocked by low legitimacy and critical supply.
 
 ### Spatial liabilities
 - Enclaves and Sarajevo encode humanitarian and diplomatic costs as systemic pressure.
- Spatial isolation creates liabilities that can be traded in negotiation.
 
 ### Negotiation as constraint resolution
 - Settlement is a budgeted exchange of liabilities and assets, not a victory state.
- Required clauses (Brcko, Sarajevo) enforce structural limits on treaties.
- Negotiation capital is intentionally scarce to force compromise.
 
 ### Asymmetric evolution
 - Factions evolve differently; doctrine and capability progression reflect historical asymmetries without scripting outcomes.
- Progression is deterministic and bounded by supply, exhaustion, and equipment.
 
 ### Determinism
 - All new systems remain deterministic, auditable, and replayable.
- Historical variability comes from initial conditions and interactions, not randomness.

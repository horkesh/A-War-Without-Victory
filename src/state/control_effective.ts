 * 2. AoR-derived control (combat-based)
 *
 * This allows negotiated territorial changes to overlay combat control
 * without conflating the two channels.
 * Phase F2: Uses settlement_control API (no raw political_controller reads).

 * Logic:
 * - If control_overrides[sid] exists => return override.side

 * This is the single source of truth for effective control used in:
 * - Treaty apply validation (preconditions)
 * - Reports and UI

 * Note: Treaty acceptance evaluation still uses AoR control directly
 * (it's fine to evaluate based on current AoR, not effective control).

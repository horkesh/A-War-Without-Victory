/**
 * Phase 15: Institutional competence valuation tables (acceptance scoring inputs only)
 *
 * Defines per-faction utility weights for each competence_id.
 * These are static tables used as inputs to treaty acceptance scoring.
 * They do NOT affect post-peace behavior or gameplay mechanics.
 *
 * Valuation philosophy:
 * - Core statehood competences (currency, international representation, border control)
 *   have high positive value to RBiH (central state aspirations).
 * - RS values autonomy-preserving competences (police, education, health) and devalues
 *   central ones (currency, international representation).
 * - HRHB values education, police, and cultural/social competences relatively higher.
 * - Some competences may be liabilities for all factions (negative values).
 * - Valuations are integers in range -10 to +10 (recommended small range).
 * - Zero is meaningful (neutral value).
 *
 * Determinism:
 * - Tables are fully explicit and statically defined.
 * - Stable ordering when iterating (sort by competence_id asc).

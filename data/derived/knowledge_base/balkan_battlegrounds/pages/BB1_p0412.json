An SVK Main Staff officer, Major\nGeneral Milisav Sekulic, claims that the evacuation of\nthe civilians from the 7th Corps area demoralized the\ndefenders, although it was supposed to allow SVK\ntroops to focus on fighting.

The SVK's biggest problem was not that\nits troops were unwilling or unprepared to fight but\nthat there were not enough of them   —   a problem recog\nnized when General Mrksic was brought in to reallo\ncate defensive formations and establish a bigger and\nbetter mobile reserve force. The Krajina Serbs had\nfought well in the attack, in another country, during\nthe Bihac battles ; and during “ Oluja \" many SVK for\nmations had been able to hold their ground against\nfrontal attacks by stronger HV forces. The SVK Main\nStaff and its corps commanders did not have enough\ncombat formations, however, to maintain the depth\nand mobility needed to contain an HV penetration.\nWhen the HV struck through SVK static defenses at\nKnin , the SVK 7th Corps commander had no units in\nreserve to resist and prevent its the capture. The only\nunit left uncommitted had been cobbled together from\nbits and pieces stripped out of the corps' line brigades.\nLack of reserves to cushion a flank attack forced the\nevacuation of the well -defended area south of Karlo\nvac, and Petrinja's stout defenses yielded when the\nreserves it counted on were committed elsewhere. All\nthe corps sectors faced the same difficulties and suf\nfered the same fate. Mrksic's ill- fated Corps of Special\nUnits was supposed to offset the lack of corps\nreserves. Although its elite troops had fought well\nagainst the 5th Corps during the attack on Bihac, the\nKSJ in “ Oluja ” failed to fulfill its primary mission as a\nroving reserve force and was able to delay the HV 1st\nGuards Brigade for no more than a day during its drive\nsouth of Slunj .\na\nAlthough part of “ Oluja- 3,” the 1st Guards Brigade's\nsuccessful advance toward Bihac was the clincher that\nfinally allowed the Karlovac Corps District's less\nwell -endowed \" Oluja - 2 ” operation to dislodge its\ntough 21st Corps opponents from their positions . The\nGuards ' drive enabled the HV to roll up the 21st\nCorps's flank so that it had to withdraw from its strong\npositions in front of Karlovac itself.\nThe loss of Petrinja and Glina defeated the 39th\nCorps, and the HV's breakthrough at Petrinja after a\nstubborn SVK defense appears directly attributable\nto the intervention of ARBiH 5th Corps troops on\n5 August: the ARBiH attack deprived General Tarbuk\nof reserves he could have fed into the Petrinja battle .\nUnaided by the ARBiH , in time the HV almost cer\ntainly would have broken through the SVK positions\naround the town on its own, but at considerably\ngreater cost in time, effort, and manpower.

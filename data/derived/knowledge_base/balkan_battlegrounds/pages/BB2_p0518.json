Igman ( 968 meters ), less tall than its\nneighbor but more important by virtue of its proximity\nto the city and the fact that the Igman road , one of\nbesieged Sarajevo's few lifelines, ran over the moun\ntain . The other peak is Mt. Bjelasnica ( 2067 meters ),\nslightly south and west of Mt. Igman and one of the\nhighest peaks in Bosnia. In addition to its towering\nheight, Bjelasnica's summit had additional value as\nthe site of a huge radio and television transmitter\none of Sarajevo's more recognizable landmarks.\nIn its many assaults on the peaks the Bosnian Army's\nreal , ultimate objective was neither Bjelasnica nor\nTreskavica themselves, but the town of Trnovo .

Trnovo was\nalso a gateway to the Drina Valley, where a road con\ntinued on to Serb- held Foca and - ultimately\nGorazde. By virtue of its location , Trnovo became one\nof the most sought- after ARBiH objectives in eastern\nBosnia.\nThe 1994 offensives against both Bjelasnica and\nTreskavica were carried out by the ARBiH's 1st\nCorps, with only a minor supporting attack by the\n4th Corps to the south .\nBoth Igman and Bjelasnica had been captured by the\nBosnian Serbs in mid - 1993, but were placed under\nUN control after the threat of NATO airstrikes com\npelled the VRS to withdraw from   the mountains.\nSince the 14 August 1993 UN -imposed demilitariza\ntion agreement, the UN held control of the peaks with\nthe understanding that UN peacekeepers would keep\nthe DMZ free of combatants or equipment from any of\nthe factions. The ostensible demilitarization did not ,\nhowever, keep the Bosnian Army from stationing\ntroops on both peaks. Probably as many as\n2,000 ARBiH troops occupied the “ UN -controlled”\nmountains at any given time, and even more worked\non prepared defenses , bunkers and trenchlines within\nthe demilitarized zone .

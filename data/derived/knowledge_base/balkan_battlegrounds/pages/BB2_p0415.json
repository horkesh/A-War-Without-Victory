Croatian press accounts suggest that a\nVJ officer, Lieutenant Colonel Momir Cvijovic, was in charge of the\naction along the Bratunac road and that he was wounded during the\naction .

Colonel Miladin\nPrstojevic , Chief of Operations and Training /Drina Corps, arrived in\nBratunac in early January to coordinate the defense of Bratunac and\nSkelani and liase with supporting VJ forces. He was followed by Colo\nnel Svetozar Parezanin . Parezanin previously commanded or was the\nchief of staff in the \" Podrinje\" Operational Group/Herzegovina Corps\ncovering the southern Drina valley prior to the formation of the Drina\nCorps. It is unclear whether he was on the Drina Corps staff or worked\nfor the Main Staff. Colonel Dragutin Ilic, the former commander of the\nEast Bosnia Corps and described on 8 March as “ from   the headquarters\nof the Army of the Serbian Republic, \" followed Parezanin and may\nhave been authorized to exercise command responsibility for the entire\noperation - absent Mladic and Milovanovic - given his apparent\ninvolvement in the 24 March mortar incident in Srebrenica. After Ilic\ncame Colonel Rajko Balac , whose normal position was Chief of Artil\nlery/ VRS Main Staff, who may have had the same responsibilities as\nIlic .\nIn addition to the VRS , the VJ and Serbian MUP each had at least one\nsenior commander on site . Major General Mile Mrksic --of Vukovar\nfame — was the commander of the VJ Corps of Special Units and appar\nently was present in Skelani to oversee the employment of VJ forces\n( and possibly more-see below ) . \" Frenki” Simatovic, the right-hand\nman of Serbian State Security chief Jovica Stanisic , and Obrad Ste\nvanovic. Serbian Special Police commander, coordinated the opera\ntions of the “ Red Beret\" troops, possibly together with Captain Dragan .\nSimatovic, Stevanovic, and the “ Red Berets \" also exercised operational\ncontrol over Branislav Vakic's Serbian Chetnik Movement volunteers\n( see Vakic footnote above . )\nWith so many high - powered officers floating around, it is difficult to\nfind where the Drina Corps staff under Colonel Zivanovic fit in . Instead\nof relying on the Drina Corps, the Main Staff may have set up its own\noperational group - possibly under the succession of colonels listed\nabove - with a set of tactical groups covering the different attack axes.\nThus one tactical group would cover Vlasenica -Cerska, another\nZvornik - Kamenica, another Bratunac -Potocari-Srebrenica, and another\nSkelani - Srebrenica . One note of caution, however, is Branislav Vakic's\nrevelation of a document that showed General Mrksic as commander of\n\" Tactical Group- 1\" in Skelani . It is unlikely that Mrksic was serving\nunder a VRS colonel if he was leading a tactical group on the Skelani\nSrebrenica axis. Mrksic's tactical group may instead have included just\nthe VJ troops on the border, rather than any VRS tactical groups fight\ning against Srebrenica. See Zorica Mladinovic, “ General Perisic Gave\nUs Uniforms , the Army Gave Us Weapons, and Special Troops of the\nMinistry of Internal Affairs of Serbia Trained Us \" Belgrade Telegraf\n28 September 1994, pp . 6-7 for an interview with Branislav Vakic in\nwhich he displays a document affirming Mrksic's position as com\nmander of TG - 1.\nAt the end of the operation the Drina Corps formed a new operational\nor tactical group under the command of Colonel Vukota Vukovic ( with\nformer Ist Bratunac Brigade commander Lieutenant Colonel Ognjen\novic as his deputy ) to control the units remaining in position around the\nenclave. “ On Position With Bratunac Troops : No One Can Defeat the\nPeople, \" Vojska 6 May 1993 , pp . 26-27 .\nMirjana Micic, “ Constantly in Motion ,\" Srpska Vojska 25 January\n1994, p. 25 ; an article on the Protection Regiment.

The 10 February date is based on an anal\nysis of the fighting as reported in Sarajevo Radio and Belgrade Tanjug.\nSarajevo Radio provided the most detail on 10 February as to the attack\naxes of the VRS advance . It is true that on 7 February the same station\nhad claimed that the VRS had attempted a breakthrough at Cerska on\n7 February, but no further detail was provided .

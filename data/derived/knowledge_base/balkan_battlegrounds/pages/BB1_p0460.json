I decided at once to send another\nthree platoons to that area ... Less than an hour later, I\nmyself went to make the rounds of the army sent to help the\n2nd Ozren Brigade and to spend the night with them,\nbecause I expected a new attack in the morning. In the area\nof Azbest (an asbestos mine ) , I met some forces coming\nfrom the direction of Manastir ( an Orthodox monastery near\nthe frontline) with one of my platoons. They told me that\nthere was no longer a line and that the entire 2nd Ozren Bri\ngade had withdrawn . I sent them back, and then near\nManastir I saw the chaotic situation ; there were about 300\nmen , five or six tanks, self-propelled guns, three -barrel guns\n( air defense artillery ) , mortars, and material.\nI stopped a tank which headed a column, turned it athwart\non the road, and thus prevented the column from retreating\nfurther. At that time, I learned from the commander of the\nIst Battalion (of the 1st Ozren Brigade ) that there was no\nline from Borice to Bukovica ( a distance of about 15 km ) . I\nsucceeded in persuading the soldiers to get down from the\nvehicle , although some of the soldiers were reluctant.\nSrpska Vojska then writes:\nThat was where commander Vasiljevic called for an\nadvance toward the village of Stupari in order to protect the\nright flank of the 1st Battalion and its possible withdrawal .\nIt was nighttime, about 2200 hours.

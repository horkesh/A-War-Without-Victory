The VRS\nrenewed the operation on 30 April with an attack on\nthe important Zaglavak hill , whose capture would\nhave allowed the Serbs to look down on the Muslim\ncontrolled Ustipraca-Mededa-Visegrad road running\nalong the Drina. After three fruitless days, the Serbs\ncalled off the attack .\nOn 7 May, the VRS appears to have partially cracked\nthe Muslim defense line, but was unable to penetrate\ninto the heart of the pocket.

Why Mladic and the\nMain Staff called off the operation still remains\nunclear. They may have decided that Zepa was not\nworth the effort and the losses that total occupation of\nthe enclave would require at that point.

A follow\non attack against the Dobrinja district would have then\ncut the last link to the airport and eliminated the newly\nconstructed supply tunnel under the airport to But\nmir. At the same time, General Galic's troops would\nundertake a second sub -operation to capture key hills\nand roads north of the city, near Ilijas, Semizovac, and\nVogosca. The seizure of these positions would elimi\nnate key positions from which Bosnian Army forces\ncould undertake further operations to attempt the\ncity's relief, while more closely linking the Ilijas area\nwith Serb-held territory to the east.\nThe biggest military event of the siege during 1993 ,\ndescribed in the previous section , was the VRS cap\nture of Mount Igman in August that cut the city's last\nsupply line-other than the UN—and stirred an inter\nnational response that forced a Serb withdrawal.\nOther important clashes included battles at Azici and\nStup in February and March, which were part of an\noperation the VRS had initiated in December, begin\nning with the capture of Otes, to further isolate Sara\njevo. Loss of the suburbs, particularly if followed up\nby the capture of Dobrinja, would leave Bosnian\nArmy troops even further from the UN-controlled air\nport and the ARBiH troops in Hrasnica - Butmir -Mount\nIgman . It would also have precluded use of the new\ntunnel the ARBiH was digging under the airport to\nHrasnica. The Bosnian Army victory at Stup, follow\ning the loss of Azici, thwarted this plan.

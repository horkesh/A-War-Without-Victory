By seizing the towns of Jajce, Sipovo, and\nDrvar, the operation would roll up large swathes of\nterritory on the approaches to the Sana and Vrbas\nRiver valleys . The capture of these areas would also\nplace Banja Luka in jeopardy, though not in imminent\ndanger\ntwo with one part of the force heading toward Mrkon\njic Grad and the other toward Sanski Most. The sec\nond group, with the other four brigades, was to attack ,\non the Krupa- Bosanski Novi- Prijedor axis.647 Briga\ndier General Mehmed Alagic's 7th Corps was to take\nDonji Vakuf, which had resisted repeated ARBiH\nassaults since 1994, then push on in the general direc\ntion of Banja Luka, passing through Skender Vakuf\nand Kotor Varos. If possible , the 5th and 7th Corps\nwere to link up near Mrkonjic Grad. Although Col.\nSenad Dautovic's reinforced 77th Division would\nspearhead the 7th Corps drive on Donji Vakuf, virtu\nally all of Alagic's 12 combat brigades, comprising\n20,000 men, were to be involved .648\nGeneral Gotovina, the commander of the HV Split\nCorps District, was placed in overall command of\nwhat the HV/HVO officially designated the “ Croatian\nForces.\" The attack plan devised by Gotovina and his\nstaff consisted of three phases, the first two of which\nfocused on the Jajce - Sipovo axis. In the opening\nassault the joint HV /HVO Operational Group “ North ”\nwould fight its way through the VRS frontline\ndefenses along a string of mountains northeast of\nGlamoc, especially the Mliniste pass and the 1,900\nmeter Vitorog heights that dominated it. After break\ning into and through these defenses, OG “North”\ntroops would exploit their breakthrough by advancing\nrapidly toward Sipovo and Jajce.642 Gotovina acknowl\nedged the magnitude and importance of this aspect of\nthe operation by assigning to OG “North ” all of the\nelite shock units available , including the 4th and 7th\nGuards Brigades, the 1st Croatian Guards Brigade ( 1st\nHGZ), all three HVO Guards brigades, and other spe\ncial units totaling 11,000 troops.643 Supporting the\nmain effort during phase one and two, five HV Home\nDefense regiments and three reserve infantry brigades\ndeployed southeast and southwest of Drvar were to\nconduct holding attacks against VRS 2nd Krajina\nCorps troops in these areas .

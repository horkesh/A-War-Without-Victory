Its recapture by the VRS would further tighten\nthe siege around Sarajevo, while the timing of the\nattack would divert ARBiH attention from the immi\nnent continuation of Operation \"Lukavac 93 ” and the\ncapture of Mounts Igman and Bjelasnica.\" A month later, on 17 March, the VRS moved against\nStup, the last suburb outside the main Sarajevo dis\ntricts . The Serbs appeared to be on their way to vic\ntory over the re-titled 102nd Motorized Brigade, and\nwhen they claimed to have captured Stup on\n20 March, residents fled the town . The ARBiH 1st\nCorps quickly moved additional reinforcements into\nthe Stup area, digging in around the Stup highway\nbridge and the Stupsko Brdo sectors . The corps also\nshifted its small tank force —   no more than 10 tanks\nto the area, and on 22 March fought unusual tank\nagainst-tank engagements with the VRS . UN observ\ners counted over 2,400 detonations before they almost\ncertainly lost count in the heavy fighting. Overex\ntended by their desire to make good their claim to\nStup, the Serbs exposed themselves to a counterattack\nby ARBiH troops that drove them back almost to their\nstart line . The defeat forced the Sarajevo -Romanija\nCorps to halt its campaign to capture the rest of the\nwestern suburbs.\nThe VRS “ Vogosca\" Operational Group of the Sara\njevo -Romanija Corps commanded the Vogosca, Rajlo\nvac, and Kosevo Infantry Brigades which normally\ncontrolled the sector around Zuc . For the attack, the\nVRS Main Staff apparently reinforced the OG with\ntwo infantry battalions from the 6th Sanske Infantry\nBrigade/ lst Krajina Corps, armor support from the 1st\nSarajevo Mechanized Brigade , and probably small\nVRS or special police assault units to bolster organic\nbrigade -level special units. The total number of com\nbat troops probably was about 2,500 to 3,000 men .\nThe ARBiH 1st Corps also had three brigades, the\n2nd, 1st, and 9th Motorized Brigades, in the Zuc sec\ntor, deployed respectively opposite Rajlovac and Vog\nosca, and north of government-held Kosevo . ARBiH\ntroops probably numbered 8,000, with the usual com\nplement of about 50 percent possessing small arms.\nWhile the battles for the suburbs raged, the 1st Ilijas\nand 1st Vogosca Brigades launched an attack in mid\nFebruary to capture the Semizovac - Srednje road and\nplateau.

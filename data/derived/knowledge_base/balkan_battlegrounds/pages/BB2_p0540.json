Major Gen\neral Momir Talic, the corps commander, assembled\ntwo brigade - sized forces for the operation : a tactical\ngroup with at least a battalion each from the\n5th Kozara Light Infantry, 6th Sanske Infantry, and\n43rd Prijedor Motorized Brigades, and the 1st Bijel\njina Light Infantry Brigade “ Panthers” from the East\nBosnian Corps. Elements of the corps ' special units,\nthe 1st Military Police Battalion and 1st Reconnais\nsance-Sabotage Company, reinforced the infantry for\nmations as shock troops.

In addition\nto corps artillery units, elements of the 11th Krupa\nLight Infantry Brigade/2nd Krajina Corps would pro\nvide fire support from its positions along the facing\nbank of the Una. Colonel Zarko Gajic's SVK 39th\nBanija Corps mobilized the 33rd Dvor Infantry Bri\ngade along the border, plus 155mm howitzer units, to\nsupport the VRS attack . Total VRS/SVK forces in this\nsector numbered about 4,000 assault troops, plus up to\n3,000 sector -holding infantry. The corps plan called\nfor an initial advance towards Otoka along the Una\nRiver with the objective of seizing the town and then\ndriving along the main highway through Bosanska\nKrupa to link up with 2nd Krajina Corps forces oppo\nsite the Grabez. Once this attack was under way and\n( it was hoped ) drawing in the 5th Corps reserves, the\nVRS would send a second column , led by the “ Pan\nthers ” and the 33rd Dvor Brigade , towards Buzim\nwith the initial objective of taking the town and then\npushing on towards the vital road and logistics hub of\nCazin .

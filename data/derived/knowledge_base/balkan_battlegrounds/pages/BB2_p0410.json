The first\nwas to directly link the Herzegovina region with the\nrest of Republika Srpska.47 So far, the Serbs lacked\nany primary road connecting Herzegovina and the\nSerb-held areas around Sarajevo . Their only territorial\nlink was the narrow strip running from Foca to\nCajnice and then Visegrad.48 The second objective\nwas the severing of the Muslim supply route to\nGorazde, which would be a natural by -product of a\nsuccessful link-up with Serb forces near Sarajevo.\nOn 2-3 July, Colonel Ratko Bundalo's Tactical Group\n“Kalinovik ” /Herzegovina Corps opened the offensive,\nstriking with 1st Guards Motorized Brigade towards\nRogoj pass from   the south .

By\n20 July VRS forces had advanced another 10 kilome\nters to the west and sat at the southeastern feet of\nIgman and Bjelasnica.

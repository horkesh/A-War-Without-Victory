From this direction , Serb troops were\nwithin four to five kilometers of the center of Bihac\ncity. However, 5th Corps troops stood firm on most of\nthe plateau.\nInitially, however, only SVK TG-6 and 7/ 15th Corps\nattacked, together with the VRS forces on the Grabez\nplateau ( see above ). TG-7/ 15th Corps made a quick\npenetration of the ARBiH 517th Mountain Brigade's\nborder zone at Bugari. At the end of the first day, SVK\nunits , backed by “ Gazelle \" light attack helicopters,\nhad advanced three kilometers on an eight-kilometer\nfront, approaching the village of Gata Ilidza.\nHowever, further south, TG -6 /15th Corps had less\nsuccess in its attack toward Izacic, making less than a\nkilometer of gains against the 501st Bihac Mountain\nBrigade. TG - 6 and TG-7 assaults, together with VRS\nattacks on Grabez, continued over the next four days,\nbut gained little ground, although they did pin down\n5th Corps troop reserves . Serb airstrikes against\n5th Corps headquarters in Bihac on 18 November and\nagainst an ammunition storage site in Cazin on\n19 November missed their targets and had little\nimpact on the ground battle .\nThe Serb approach to Bihac had evoked open ex\npressions of concern from the UN and the inter\nnational community that the Serbs would attempt\nto capture and occupy the city and drive out its\n70,000 residents. 36 The Croatian government had\nwarned that it would take a hand in the fighting if\nBihac were threatened . Now the SVK and VRS\nappeared to have Bihac at their mercy. To the relief of\nsome, however, although the Serbs continued fighting\nfor some outlying villages and positions, they seemed\nto be making no effort to capture the city itself.\nGeneral Milovanovic claimed after the war that Serb\nforces never intended to enter Bihac . In one interview,\nhe said\nWith 5th Corps partially diverted, the SVK TG -5 ,\ntogether with the VRS TG -3 , now launched the main\nSerb assault on the Bihac city defenses . On 20\nNovember SVK /VRS units hit the weak HVO 101st\nBihac Brigade — some 500 men—in the Croat villages\nof Veliki Skocaj, Mali Skocaj , Medrudrazje, and\nZavalje directly south of Bihac. HVO defenses rapidly\ncollapsed, and elements of the 502nd Bihac Mountain\nBrigade quickly shifted to the area were unable to halt\nthe Serb advance . By 23 November SVK and VRS\ninfantry were preparing to assault the vital 570- meter\nDebeljaca hill directly overlooking Bihac city.\nDebeljaca fell to Serb forces on 23/24 November.\nMeanwhile, to the west, TG -2 troops also had pushed\n501st Bihac Brigade elements back to the village of\nKlokot, where the city's water works was located.35\nOn 26 November the village of Vedro Polje fell and\nSVK /VRS troops pushed into Zegar, less than two\nkilometers from the center of Bihac and less than a\nkilometer from the city hospital . NATO air strikes\nagainst the SVK's Udbina Air Base on 21 November\n( in response to the Serb air strikes launched from\nthere ) and against VRS air defense sites east of Bihac\nhad no effect on the Serb attack.

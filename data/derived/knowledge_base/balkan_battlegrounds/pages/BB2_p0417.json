We were on the roof, and then we\nclimbed down , took chairs, and sat . I watched the progress of\nthe fighting there across Bjelasnica, our drive to the west, and\nalso looked to the west across Igman. At one point that ( UN\nobserver ] Piterson asked me, ' Whose army is on Igman ?” I said,\n* Ours. ' He said , 'That's not right. I just came from   there, and\nthat is the Muslims ' headquarters . ' But before that he had\nreproached me for flying by helicopter. I told him, ' I flew , what\nof it ? I am General Mladic , the commander of the Forces of the\nRepublika Srpska, surely you don't expect me to ride a don\nkey!?' And since he had thus provoked me, as if he would give\nme permission and as if I would ask him how I could travel, I\nsaid this about his claim   that there were Muslims on Igman :\n* Fine , I will go there now .. ' I told the pilot, 'Get the helicopter\nready !' I sat down in the helicopter and went down . ( When they\nsaw where my pilot was taking me, they could not believe their\neyes . ) I set down below , gathered my commanders, held a meet\ning, issued the necessary orders, did my job, and then returned\nto Bjelasnica. Then I asked him ( Piterson ), 'Well, whose army\nis down there?! '\nJovan Janjic, Srpski General Ratko Mladic Novi Sad : Matica Srpska\nPress, 1996, Chapter 11 .\nAs at Srebrenica, Mladic was again up front with his troops. Mladic\nlater described part of the advance from Trnovo,\nAbove the village of Sabic ,at Precko Polje, on 14 July 1993 , we\nset out to seize the road to Igman . There are some medieval\ntombstones there. Precko Polje is a small plateau of several\nhundred meters. It looks like some sort of terrace . To the north\nis Igman , while to the west the Serbs held a characteristic peak,\nProskok. That elevation , between Treskavica and Bjelasnica, is\nlike an ax , with its cutting edge turned to the sky. The eastern\nslope is wooded . That is where the Muslims were firmly\nentrenched. They bitterly defended the approaches to Proskok\nand Igman. The Muslims had completely burned down the vil\nlages below Treskavica, such as Serb Ledici , expelling and kill\ning Serbs along the way. Here were also the Muslim villages of\nDejcini (sic - Dejcici), Vojkovici, Sabici...\nPart of the unit was operating out of the village of Ledici ,\ntoward Proskok (defended by the ARBiH 82nd Mountain Bri\ngade) . We knew that they had strong forces up there. We had\ndone a good job observing and reconnoitering them. But our\nposition down below was unfavorable . We were in a hole , a\nravine, so thatthey could easily fire on us ... We entered the\nvillage of Dejcini ( sic ) and routed a smallish unit of theirs there ,\nwhich was offering the last resistance in the village of Sabici .\nThey fled Sabici head over heels, whereby some of them were\nkilled , some were wounded , and some were captured . From\nthere we had to advance further, to Precko Polje. I knew that\nthey had defenses there , that it would be very firm . ' That is\nwhy I ordered the commander of the Ilidza Brigade to direct his\nforces from Dejcici toward Proskok, to pass between Proskok\nand Siljak under Bjelasnica itself, in the Baba Valley. Since I\nhad no other forces working on securing the road and we were\navoiding the road because they were firing on anything moving\non it ( by maintaining control of that road, they also made it\nimpossible for us to use that route to transport equipment ), that\nis why I and my escort set out in that direction while I sent the\nothers to the left and right of the road, because they were direct\ning a lot of fire at us. In Dejcici they fired at us with some of\ntheir howitzers and mortars, but fortunately to no avail . Because\nof their artillery fire, I forced an attack. I placed my escort and\nordered them to maintain a connection with that unit.\nWe left for Precko Polje. The Muslims attacked there strongly\nall day long, all the way until evening . At one point, the situa\ntion was very critical . Colleagues who were next to me sug\ngested that I withdraw from there and let them continue. ' No,\nGod forbid !' I said. “ I am not retreating !' There were no more\nthan ten of us there, one girl, several soldiers, and several of us\nofficers. At the point when one of the officers was bringing me\na report on the situation of the neighboring units and asking me\nto withdraw, to go back, one soldier from escort, who had just\nhad a bullet pass through his pants below the knee , ( leaving no\nwound, fortunately ), said, “ Now you cannot go back there, I\nhave just returned from there . One of our soldiers died right\nnext to me. A bullet hit a grenade on his belt . He died from the\nexplosion .... Since I had the habit of addressing soldiers as\n'chief,' that is also how they often addressed me. That soldier\nstopped and turned to me again : ' Chief, you cannot continue\nwith the road operation . The Turks have cut the road off ...' I\nwas a little angry with him for saying in front of the others that\none of our soldiers had been killed; I was afraid of panic erupt\ning among our men . That is why I angrily yelled at him , ' Who\nordered you to come back here ?! He was a little confused :\n“Well, I came here to inform you ... I ordered him , ' Back to\nyour position !' He returned and the ones next to me now\nstepped up their efforts to get me to withdraw from there. I said\ncurtly and angrily : \"Stop that ! I never retreat!' After that, no one\ndared mention retreating to me . That evening , at 2020, the rest\nofour units arrived there ...\nJovan Janjic, Srpski General Ratko Mladic Novi Sad : Matica Srpska\nPress, 1996 , Chapter 11 .\n54 Mirjana Micic, \" Constantly in Motion , ” Srpska vojska 25 January\n1994, p . 25 , an article on the Protection Regiment.

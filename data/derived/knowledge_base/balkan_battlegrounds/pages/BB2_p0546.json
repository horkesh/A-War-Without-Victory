Absolutely\nloyal to their charismatic commander, the 5th Corps\ntroops thought they could beat anything — even the\nlong odds that still faced their surrounded force even\nafter the defeat of Fikret Abdic's rebels .

Dudakovic's forces achieved near-complete\nsurprise, and their gains on the first day were\nsubstantial. Government forces, comprising the 501 st\nMountain , 502nd Mountain, 503rd Mountain, and 1st\nBosnian Liberation Brigades, captured the Grabez\nbarracks and much of the long-contested Grabez\nplateau east of Bihac from the four long-suffering\ninfantry /light infantry brigades of the VRS 2nd\nKrajina Corps on the plateau .? The Grabez barracks\nand plateau directly overlooked Bihac itself, and\nBosnian Serb forces had shelled the town constantly\nfrom these positions. For the first time in two and a\nhalf years, Bihac's residents could enjoy a reprieve\nfrom the threat of shelling.\nBy 27 October the Bosnian Army had taken between\n100 and 150 square kilometers of territory, and had\ncaptured several pieces of precious heavy equipment\nabandoned by the Bosnian Serbs during their\nheadlong flight. The always-underequipped Bosnian\nArmy forces had also seized and distributed the\ncontents of the just-captured Grabez barracks, an\ninfusion that magnified the weight of their advance .\nMeanwhile, Major General Grujo Boric's VRS 2nd\nKrajina Corps, still off-balance, continued to fall back\nin disarray. Fifth Corps forces advanced about 10km\nsouth towards Bosanski Petrovac and reached right up\nto the edges of Bosanska Krupa to the east. But\nalthough the exultant 5th Corps brigades continued to\npress forward, the ARBiH advance was beginning to\noutpace itself.

One battalion\neach from the 4th and 7th Guards Brigades, supported by the 6th\nand 126th Home Defense Regiments, led the HV counterattack .\nColonel General Ante Gotovina, Offensive Battles and Operations\nof the Croatian Army and HVO Knin : Split Corps District, 1996,\nVakuf, from south to north had the 707th Bugojno Mountain Bri\ngade, 770th Donji Vakuf Mountain Brigade , and the 717th Gornji\nVakuf Mountain Brigade holding its front, with the 705th Jajce\nMountain Brigade in reserve. The rest of the corps frontage from\nsouth to north was held by the 708th Light Brigade , 712th Krajina\nMountain Brigade , 706th Muslim   Light Brigade , 733rd Busovaca\nMountain Brigade , and the 725th Vitez Mountain Brigade. The\n17th Krajina Mountain Brigade, 727th Banja Luka Mountain Bri\ngade, and the 737th Muslim Light Brigade were normally in\nreserve near Travnik . Elements of the corps reserve brigades , plus\nthe 7th “Bosnjak” Reconnaissance - Sabotage Battalion, probably\nreinforced 77th Division for the operation .\n649 The 2nd Krajina Corps had the 1st Drvar Light Infantry and up\nto three Drina Corps composite formations, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd\nDrina Light Infantry Brigades - formed from elements of most of\nthe Drina Corps' brigades - deployed to defend Drvar and its\napproaches. The 1st Drvar was directly in front of the city, facing\nthe south and west, while the Drina Brigades covered the south\neastern approaches. They held a front of about 20 kilometers . In\naddition, the corps may have had the remnants of the 9th Grahovo\nLight Infantry Brigade deployed near Drvar as well, although the\nbrigade may have earlier been destroyed in “Ljeto 95. \" The rein\nforced 3rd Serbian Brigade manned the sector adjacent to the Drina\nbrigades on their left, covering the important Mliniste pass. The 7th\nKupres -Sipovo Motorized Brigade/30th Division took over from\nhere , defending the most important terrain feature— Vitorog.\n650 On the Grabez, the 2nd Krajina Corps had deployed the 15th\nBihac , 17th Kljuc ( with a battalion from the 6th Sanske Infantry\nBrigade ), 3rd Petrovac, and probably the 1st Serbian Brigades.\nFrom Bosanska Krupa through Bosanska Otoka to Bosanski Novi\n(Novigrad) were the 11th Krupa Light Infantry and 1st Novigrad\nInfantry Brigades.\n651 From south to north, Zec arrayed the 31st Light Infantry Bri\ngade, the 19th “ Srbobran \" ( Donji Vakuf) Infantry Brigade, the 11th\nMrkonjic Light Infantry Brigade ( with a battalion from the 5th\nKozara Light Infantry Brigade attached ) , the 1st Sipovo Light\nInfantry Brigade, the 22nd Krajina Infantry Brigade, and the 1st\nKotor Varos Light Infantry Brigade .\n652 The VRS probably should have shifted the 1st Sipovo and 11th\nMrkonjic Brigades to the Vitorog -Mliniste area where the two for\nmations most likely would have fought tenaciously to defend their\nhometowns. The 11th Mrkonjic in particular had acquired an excel\nlent reputation during defensive operations in the Donji Vakuf\nKomar Mountains area.\n653 This account of “Maestral\" draws primarily on Colonel General\nAnte Gotovina, Offensive Battles and Operations of the Croatian\nArmy and HVO Knin : Split Corps District, 1996, pp. 5-102 and a\nseries of articles in Zagreb Velebit commemorating the one-year\nanniversary of the operation.\n65 * The 7th Guards attacked Ministe with two battalions, each of\nwhich had one armored company attached from the brigade\narmored battalion .

I did not know the crew . I quickly\nissued orders, because I was in a hurry. I was afraid that the\nMuslims would capture the tank , because they were known to\nlet us get into a ' shooting trap , ' and that, regardless of the casu\nalties, they would attack in order to get their hands on heavy\nequipment. I did not have time to communicate with the gunner\non the BOV. Thus, I quickly assigned roles. I told the colonel,\nwho knew the people, that I would not take the radio set from\nhim and that I would command, since I did not yet know his\nsystem of command and his subordinates. I was not familiar\nwith their voices, and someone else could handle communica\ntions for me : * You, colonel , keep your men on the line and\nwatch to the left and straight ahead .' To the driver I said, ' you\nare responsible only for driving.' To the assistant driver I\nassigned a precise area of activity. Behind me, on specially\ninstalled mounts, I placed a rifle, for my escort. Thus, each per\nson had his role regarding who would watch what. I watched to\nthe right and straight ahead ...\nWe went ahead . We found the tank, but we wanted to go up to a\ncurve to reconnoiter, and then extract the tank and go further. At\none point, however, I saw a Muslim bunker above some cut. We\nhad already passed below it . All that was going on in the course\nof combat. We heard blows against the BOV. We heard our gun\nner firing from the BOV. Periodically we too , inside , fired short\nbursts. Since the Muslims were showering uswith fire , our gun\nner pulled back a little into the cabin , probably to protect him\nself, so that he did not see the bunker. As soon as I saw that\nbunker , I told the driver, ' Stop !' and I told the escort , “ get out ,\nthe bunker is up there . ' He said to me , ' please, you mustn't get\nout ! We'll do it ... ' I said , ' It's not important who does it, just\nget out!' The escort, one soldier, and I got out . That little soldier\nwas very brave and competent. He told me , ' Should I throw a\ngrenade ?!' ' Do it ! ' I said . He threw a grenade at the bunker ...\nWhen we entered that bunker, we wandered into a labyrinth of\ncommunication trenches which went out in all directions ...\nthe Muslims again began to fire from somewhere with an\nOsa' or ' Zolja' which had come between us and the tank ...\nThey had a strong sideways position for firing from a dominant\nelevation at the ‘Bajina Basta' [Perucac) dam. From there they\npounded us until we neutralized them ... Our reinforcements\narrived, so that we pushed them back and occupied very favor\nable\npositions\n.\nJovan\nJanjic\n,\nSrpski\nGeneral  Ratko\nMladic Novi Sad\n:\nMatica  Srpska\nPress\n,\n1996\n,\nChapter\n10\n.\n31\nMladic\nalso\ndescribed\nhis\nfrontline\nfrolics\naround\nOsmace\n,\nThe next day, we had strong skirmishes for the village of\nOsmace. That was a big Muslim base . General Milan Gvero and\nI arrived in that village by helicopter once it had already been\ntaken . Since I like to visit units everywhere and offer a little\nencouragement , I often used helicopters in combat . I had com\npetent pilots , so that in the course of battle, at the most critical\nmoments, I could call on several units, all the way up to the\nfront ... The next day, I landed again at the same location .\nThe same day, we set out for the Serb village of Brezani, which\nthe Muslims had burned down . The Serb village of Turija is\nalso nearby. It is between Osmace and Srebrenica. We wanted\nto liberate those Serb villages as well . There we had a [ Hill ]\n945. One commander invited me to come to that hill the next\nday ... Then I left for Zvornik . Around that time I also had a\nhelicopter accident-I flew into some high voltage wires. The\nnext day, I returned to the same place ... I'm going to (Hill ]\n945 ... I did a few landings here . These were the first Serb\nlandings. I gave 30 soldiers a lift to positions near the village of\nBrezani . I was sorry that they had to trudge through those holes\nand was afraid for them to go through the forest, because they\nmight step on mines . While I was giving them a lift , I said , ' You\ngo from here to Brezani , so we will see who is the first to arrive\nat [ Hill ] 945 ! ... From the helicopter I saw the completely\nburned-down village of Brezani and the routed Muslim   groups\nwho were withdrawing . Our soldiers had not yet entered that\nvillage, but we set down in Brezani , again next to a house .\nThus, we had crossed the front , ahead of our units . Indeed, this\nwas not the first time I had done that ... We arrived at the ele\nvation, and then the other units arrived, and later we set out ...\ntoward Zeleni Jadar ... This was a magnificent operation .The\nMuslims offered feverish resistance. Our soldiers, officers, and\nMUP members passed the test with the highest grades .\nJovan Janjic, Srpski General Ratko Mladic Novi Sad : Matica Srpska\nPress , 1996, Chapter 10 .\n32 The same day, a number of civilians, including children, were killed\nand wounded by Serb shells at a soccer field just after UN helicopters\nhad evacuated wounded from   the field. Two Canadian UN soldiers in\ntown from Morillon's earlier foray were also wounded . See Silber and\nLittle, p. 72 .\n33 See also L.

The\n63rd Airborne elements were under the command of VJ Major Goran\nOstojic, who was later killed in action in Kosovo during the summer of\n1998 while leading 63rd Airborne units during counterinsurgency oper\nations.\nMirjana Micic, “ Constantly in Motion , ” Srpska vojska 25 January\n1994, p. 25 : an article on the Protection Regiment.\n35 Silber and Little , p. 268.\n36 There are some indications that the VJ withdrew its infantry units\nfrom the operation due to unwanted international attention by the\nbeginning of April. The Serbian MUP forces and the Serbian Chetnik\nMovement volunteer troops, however, remained, and the VJ continued\nto provide artillery support. Belgrade also continued to allow the VRS\nto resupply its forces northwest of Skelani via Serbia, while probably\nproviding some of the supplies itself.\nDuring the final push against Srebrenica during March and April,\nVRS forces on the north /northwestern face of the enclave, probably\nfrom the 1st Zvornik , 1st Birac, and Ist Bratunac Brigades, mounted a\nseries of small-scale, but violent attacks to pin down Bosnian Army\ntroops in the area and keep them from reinforcing the main sector in the\nsoutheast. David Rohde states,\nIn 1993 — armed with automatic rifles and homemade guns that\nconsisted ofiron pipes filled with nails and gunpowder — the\nMuslims had fought desperately to hold half of Buljim , a 2,300\nfoot ( about 800 meters) peak that loomed over the northwest\ncorner\nof\nthe\nenclave\n.\nDavid\nRohde\n,\nEndgame\n:\nThe\nBetrayal\nand\nFall\nof\nSrebrenica\n:\nEurope's\nWorst\nMassacre\nSince\nWorld\nWar\nII\n,\nNew\nYork\n:\nFarrar\n,\nStrauss\n,\nand\nGiroux\n,\n1996.\np\n.\n8\n.\n3\n%\nGoran\nMaunaga\n,\n“\nMagnificent\nin\nMilitary\nOrder\n,\n\"\nSrpska\nvojska\n25\nJanuary\n1994\n,\npp\n.\n12-14\n;\nan\narticle\non\nthe\n1st\nGuards\nMotorized\nBri\ngade\n.\n39\nThe\nbest\naccount\nof\nthe\ntown's\nsurrender\nis\nin\nSilber\nand\nLittle\n,\npp\n.\n270-275\n.\n40\nSilber\nand\nLittle\n,\np\n.\n271\n.\n41\nSilber\nand\nLittle\n,\npp\n.\n272-273\n;\nParis\nAFP\n17  April\n1993\n.\n42\nGoran  Maunaga\n,\n“\nMagnificent\nin\nMilitary\nOrder\n,\"\nSrpska\nvojska\n25  January  1994\n,\npp\n.\n12-14\n;\nan\narticle\non\nthe\n1st\nGuards\nMotorized\nBri\ngade\n.\nNote\nthat\nthe\n2nd\nRomanija\nMotorized\nBrigade\nand\nthe\n1st\nPodrinje\nLight\nInfantry\nBrigade\nboth\nnormally  had  elements\ndeployed\naround\nZepa\n.\nThe\ntactical\ngroup\nwas\napparently designated\neither\nTacti\ncal\nGroup\n“\nDrina\n”\nor  Tactical\nGroup\n“\nZepa\n.\"\nThe 1st Podrinje (Rogatica) Light Infantry, 2nd Podrinje ( Visegrad )\nLight Infantry, and 5th Podrinje (Gorazde) Light Infantry Brigades\nmade the main effort.

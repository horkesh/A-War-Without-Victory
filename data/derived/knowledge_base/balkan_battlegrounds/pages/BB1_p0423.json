As the\nNATO “Deliberate Force \" air campaign commenced\non 30 August in response to VRS refusals to remove\nheavy weapons from the Sarajevo exclusion zone, one\nof the first targets struck was the Kraljica radio relay\nstation atop Mt. Ozren.735 736 737 The communications\nrelay station was important though not vital to VRS\ncommand and control in the area ; its loss on the eve of\nthe next ARBiH offensive in the area was certainly\ninconvenient. The tower's sudden destruction could\nhave affected the outcome of the campaign in other\nways: it might have shaken the morale of the defend\ners but, equally, it might have diminished the impor\ntance of Mt.

A huge amount of equipment had been cap\ntured, including four tanks, four tank destroyers, a\ndozen artillery pieces, hundreds of rifles and machine\nguns, and a virtual cornucopia of ammunition.751 752 753\n754 UN Special Envoy Yasushi Akashi officially con\nfirmed the Bosnian Army advances and the capture of\nVozuca on 13 September.755 756 Hit once too often and\ncaught without the elite reserves that had saved them\nin the past, the VRS Ozren Tactical Group made a vir\ntue of necessity, pulling out of the extreme southern\nbulge of the salient to shorten its defensive line and\nbetter organize its defenses.757 758\nThe\nSecond Push\n:\n15-22\nSeptember\nThe 2nd Corps' 22nd Division , spearheaded by the\nelite 9th Muslimski, 743 222nd,744 21 1th , 745 and 250th\nLiberation Brigades,746 drove east from the area of\nPribitkovici , over 5 kilometers north of Vozuca but\nalong the next major east-west road in the area.

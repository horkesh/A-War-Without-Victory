For whatever reason, Rajic\ndirected his anger against Stupni Do, a tiny town of\nsome 260 Muslim residents on one side of a mountain\nabout 4 km south of Vares itself.12 13\nThe HVO Assault on Stupni Do, 23 October 1993\nRajic &   commander of the HVO Central Bosnian\nOperational Zone's Second Operational Group, hail\ning from the hardline Bosnian Croat Kiseljak enclave\nto the south   on or before 20 October.' ( To reach\nVares, surrounded on three sides by the Bosnian Mus\nlims, Rajic and his followers transited through\nfriendly Bosnian Serb territory to the east . ) In what\ncould best be described as a local coup , Rajic and an\narmed group of extremist Croat supporters assumed\npolitical control of the Vares enclave on 23 October\nthe same day as the Stupni Do massacre . Rajic ousted\nand jailed the mayor and police chief, replacing them\nwith supporters from outside . Similarly, Rajic placed\nKresimir Bozic , one of his allies from Kiseljak , in\ncharge of the HVO's local Bobovac Brigade . Then\nthe municipality's substantial Muslim population, who\nhad until then been left alone , were harassed , robbed,\nand systematically driven from their homes . Within\ndays most of the enclave's Muslim population had\nfled to the village of Dabravina well to the south.10 11\nThe HVO infantry attack began on the morning of\n23 October, probably supported with mortars and\nsome artillery.14 Unlike Ahmici , Stupni Do was\ndefended, although only by a platoon-sized force of\n39 Bosnian Army troops with no heavy weapons.\nResistance was ineffective at best, and in all likeli\nhood any armed Muslim residents of Stupni Do were\nasleep, scattered, caught by surprise, and unable to\nmount any form of organized resistance. Over the\nnext several hours, the attacking HVO soldiers com\npletely destroyed the town, dynamiting or burning\nevery single building to the ground and killing any\nresidents who did not escape in time.is\n1\nAt roughly the same time that Ivica Rajic was arriving\nand installing a hardline Bosnian Croat government in\nVares, the Bosnian Army was massing its forces to\nattack the enclave . Which event precipitated which\nor, indeed, if the two are even linked—remains uncer\ntain. But whether or not it was Rajic's arrival that\nspurred the ARBiH into action , it is a fact that the\nBosnian government had transferred all or part of at\nleast three brigades into the area and was poised to\nattack by late October.\nThe HVO, while denying that a massacre had\noccurred, at first prevented UN peacekeepers from\nentering the village to investigate Bosnian Govern\nment claims of Croat atrocities . HVO troops simulta\nneously placed mines on the road approaches to the\ntown and threatened UN vehicles with anti -tank weap\nons. Troops from UNPROFOR’s newly -arrived Nor\ndic Battalion 216 were blocked at the outskirts of the\ntown on 25 October, but were able to approach close\nenough to at least confirm that the village had indeed\nbeen razed . 17\n1\nAlthough the Bosnian Croats may have instigated\nevents by driving the Muslims from their homes, the\nBosnian Army was the first to begin actual military\noperations in the Vares area. The ARBiH appear to\nhave made its first attack against the town of Ratanj ,\nhalfway between Kakanj and Vares, on 19 October.\nGovernment forces went on to capture the Croat\nmajority village of Kopjari — 10 km southwest of\nVares - on 21 October, killing three HVO soldiers and\nforcing the town's population to flee. This latter\nattack apparently infuriated Rajic, and evidently moti\nvated him   to order an HVO assault against a Muslim\nvillage in response. It is possible that Rajic and the\nVares Croats had already concluded that the Vares\nenclave was indefensible, and were planning to evacu\nate the population to Serb-held territory to the east. If\nSwedish peacekeepers finally gained access to the\ndestroyed village late on 26 October, three days after\nthe attack . While it was clear that the Bosnian Croats\nhad used the intervening time to clean up the town and\nremove or destroy evidence, there was still enough left\nthat there was little question what had happened.\nMost striking was the discovery of three dead women\nwho had been discovered hiding under a trap door and\nthen executed.

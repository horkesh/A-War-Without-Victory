The attack plan called for the\n81st Guards Battalion to form the main spearhead , bypassing these\ndefenses to the north , attacking from the the Masicka Sagovina\narea toward the village of Cage, north of Okucani . The battalion\nwould then push directly into Okucani itself. This part of the plan\nappears to have gone awry, however. Bobetko states that,\nI spoke with General Stipetic three or four times. He had to\npersonally go out to check on things, because of which the\nstrike in the (Nova ] Gradiska area came late . The 81st\nGuard Brigade ( sic ), which was responsible for that delicate\ntask , learned of its mission only two and a half or three\nhours later. Accordingly, it set out for its target only after the\nenemy was prepared, after the operation had already begun.\nA similar thing happened with other units as well ... In ana\nlyzing the mission in this region, General Stipetic concluded\nthat the units were as much as two hours late . Viewed from\nthat perspective, this was the most criminal and dangerous\nthing that could have happened in this operation. There was\nno reason for this, so that the underlying responsibility of\nwho was in charge of that was sought .\nAs a result, the 4th Battalion/5th Guards Brigade and the 265th\nRecon Company, together with the Armored Company / 123rd\nInfantry Brigade , were forced to intervene and bludgeon their way\nthrough the SVK 54th Light Infantry Brigade at Dragalic. The\nGuards troops then pushed on toward Okucani, while the recon\ncompany moved toward Nova Varos and Stara Gradiska to try and\ncut the main SVK withdrawal route . It appears that SVK rear\nguards were too strong, however, and the Serbs were able to with\ndraw across the river unhindered .\nColonel General Petar Stipetic played a major role in ensuring that\nthis axis was put back on track and well coordinated. Bobetko says,\nIf it were not for General Stipetic , we probably would not\nhave gotten a real picture of what was going on , because on\nsuch a broad front it is impossible to keep the situation\nunder control.

The commis\nsion was comprised of five members, including the RSK Internal\nAffairs Minister, the deputy chairman of the Assembly, two SVK\ncolonels, and another senior RSK MUP officer. The commission\nfound that RSK President Milan Martic was primarily responsible\nfor the loss of Western Slavonia because of his closure of the\nBelgrade-Zagreb highway, refusal to reopen it, and failure to\ncoordinate the defense of the RSK through the Supreme Defense\nCouncil .

Col.\nGeneral Milan Celeketic for failing to properly oversee the defense\nof Western Slavonia and ignoring the threat from Zagreb when he\nand Martic refused to reopen the highway on 30 April.

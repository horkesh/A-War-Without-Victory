The mobile reserve\nforce of Major General Milorad Stupar's KSJ ,\nalthough committed to Serb operations against Bihac,\nwas also available in this sector, especially after Serb\ntroops started withdrawing from the enclave. Bosanac\ncontrolled three infantry brigades, only two of which\nwould be engaged against the Karlovac Corps — about\n4,000 men . (The third was stuck between Karlovac\nand Zagreb Corps Districts.) Most of a 1,500-man\ninfantry brigade from the 15th Lika Corps was also in\nthe zone of the Karlovac Corps attack.

The corps would then sweep the\nborder area of SVK outposts and pockets of resis\ntance.

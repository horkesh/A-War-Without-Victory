In this instance, the long front\nline held by the 505th Motorized Brigade should have\nenabled the VRS to penetrate Muslim defenses and\npush quickly towards its objectives. Instead, ARBiH\ntroops fought hard , delaying the Serb attack while the\nMuslims grouped and infiltrated a large number of\nrecon-sabotage units into the VRS/SVK rear in prepa\nration for a major counterattack.

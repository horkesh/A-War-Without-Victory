The success of\nthe 5th Corps stand became even more apparent when\nMilovanovic had to renew the VRS/SVK drive during\nDecember, trying to drive Dudakovic's forces from\nthe Grabez and from the western approaches to Bihac\ncity. VRS and SVK formations attacked in the Bugari ,\nIzacic, Grabez, and Krupa areas, but failed to break\nout on to the plain . In the Bugari area, elements of the\n502nd and 517th Brigades even managed to retake\nmost of the ground lost in November.

Thereafter,\nOperation Sharp Guard would, on average, consist of\neight ships from NATO's Standing Naval Force Medi\nterranean (STANAVFORMED ), seven ships from the\nStanding Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT),\nand six WEU vessels, as well as several maritime\npatrol aircraft.10\n1\nBoth practical and political difficulties severely ham\npered the No - Fly Zone enforcement mission.

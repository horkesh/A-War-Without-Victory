How\never, there were many volunteers, I alone had 300 men on that\nsection of the battlefield. There were not enough weapons and\nuniforms for all of us . I sought help from General Momcilo\nPerisic , currently chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav\nArmy, who was then the commander of the 3rd Army in Nis .\nI went from Skelani to meet him three times . He promised, and\nsupplied, uniforms for 80 fighters, underwear, some food, and a\nset of night-vision binoculars that I needed . I did not receive\nany weapons from him , but he put me in contact with Major\nGeneral Ojdanic, Uzice Army (Corps ) commander.

At that time, the Yugoslav Army needed us\nand the cooperation was good .\nThere was a lot of such cooperation ( with the Serbian MUP ). In\nbattles from   Skelani to Srebrenica, we fought alongside the spe\ncial forces of the MUP, under the command of Obrad Ste\nvanovic , the third man in the Serbian MUP. I had excellent\ncooperation with him   on the Skelani battlefield . He had his\nheadquarters in Bajina Basta, and I would travel from Skelani to\ntalk to him . I would go to him   whenever I needed something,\nand he would issue orders about where one should go. From   the\nbeginning of April until 25 May last year ( 1993 ) , we fought\nalongside the special forces of the MUP .\nA note of appreciation was sent to the “ Old Serbia ” Volunteer\nUnit.

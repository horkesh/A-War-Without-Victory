Bugojno was a large town that before\nthe war had numbered about 46,000 residents with a\nMuslim plurality ( 42 percent ) and substantial minori\nties of Croats (34 percent) and Serbs (about 20 per\ncent ). The ethnic balance in the town began to change\nsoon after the war began in the spring of 1992 , when\nmost of the Serbs left almost immediately for Serb\ncontrolled areas, while both Bosnian Croat and Mus\nlim refugees streamed in from Jajce and other areas\nlost to the Bosnian Serb Army .

In early 1995, the Bosnian Government's Ministry of\nHealth and Social Welfare claimed 105,000 Muslim civilians and\nsoldiers had been killed . If true, the bulk of these probably died\nduring 1992. It's unlikely that this exceptionally high death rate\ncontinued after 1992 but probably was more in line with the 1.3 to\n1.5 percent dead associated with the VRS and HVO, although pos\nsibly somewhat higher, given that the ARBiH was often on the\nattack and relied heavily on its manpower. An estimate of 25,000 to\n30,000 official ARBiH soldiers killed in action seems likely—as\nopposed to the many armed civilians who died in 1992 and proba\nbly were not on official Territorial Defense or ARBiH rolls\nalthough it could be higher.\na\n.\na\n425",

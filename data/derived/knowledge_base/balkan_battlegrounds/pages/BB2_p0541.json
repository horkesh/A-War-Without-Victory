Around\nBihac city and the Grabez, 5th Corps defenses relied\non the 501st Bihac, 502nd Bihac, 503rd Cazin , and\n1st Bosnian Liberation Brigades to hold the line . On\nthe Buzim-Otoka axis, the corps had the entire\n505th Buzim Motorized Brigade and most of the\n511th Bosanska Krupa Mountain Brigade. All told,\nthe 5th Corps mustered about 15,000 troops for the\nbattle .\nARBiH 511th Mountain Brigade back towards Otoka,\ncrossing the Bastra River on 8-9 September. At this\npoint, the attack towards Otoka—now only one\nkilometer from the town—stalled . Muslim troops dug\nin around two key hills above Otoka, Vuckovac and\nPlavna. For four days the VRS hurled strong attacks\nagainst the hills, whose capture would have given\nthem the town, to no avail .\nBattle for\nGrabez\nPlateau\n,\n31\nAugust\n6\nSeptember\n1994\nOn 8 September, the same day as the attack across the\nBastra, the \" Panthers \" and the SVK 33rd Dvor Bri\ngade, supported by at least a company of tanks,\nattacked about 10 to 15 kilometers north of Otoka,\nbetween the Corkovaca and Radac hills on the Croat\nian - Bosnian border. Their objective was Buzim, some\n10 kilometers down the road. Facing Major Izet\nNanic's ARBiH 505th Motorized Brigade , the VRS\npenetrated two kilometers into Muslim defenses on\n8-9 September. Attacks on 10-11 September, despite\nstrong artillery support from inside the RSK, yielded\nonly minor gains.\nThe 2nd Krajina Corps attack at Grabez began on\n31 August and proceeded in the same manner as most\nof the previous VRS attempts to seize the Una valley\nhad gone. Initial objectives for the Serb brigades were\nthe Alibegovica Kosa and Barakovac hill ( Hill 453 )\nareas, the capture of which would have permitted VRS\nunits to take the river plain and the villages of Spahici ,\nJezero, and Srbljani . The rail lines running north from\nBihac city would then be in striking distance . As\nusual , the VRS made some progress in taking both hill\nmasses, but 5th Corps did not crack. Instead , it\nlaunched a counterattack on 6 September, led by the\n503rd Cazin Mountain Brigade, that erased VRS gains\nand even seized some previously Serb-held ground.\nAlthough sporadic fighting continued on the plateau\nfor several more days , for 2nd Krajina the battle was\nessentially over .\nOn 12 September the “ Panthers” renewed the attack,\npummeling ARBiH defenses southwest of Corkovaca.\nThe 5th Corps, however, had been preparing a major\ncounterattack . Elite recon-sabotage units of the 505th\nMotorized Brigade — the “ Hamza ” and “Gazije” com\npanies and the \" Tajfun ” battalion-had been withdrawn\nfrom the frontline, while additional recon -sabotage\nelements from at least the 502nd Bihac Mountain and\n517th Light Brigades were transferred to the area.? As\nthe VRS assault struck the ARBiH defenses, the\nregrouped Muslim special units , which had apparently\ninfiltrated neighboring SVK positions, struck the\n“ Panthers” in the flank. The Serb attack collapsed,\nand the “ Panthers ” and the SVK 33rd Dvor Brigade\ntroops withdrew in disorder.
